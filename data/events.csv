A Reassessment of Hebbian Mechanisms in Visual System Development by in vivo Imaging,Seminar: Oxyopia Seminar,2014-03-03T19:00:00+00:00,2014-03-03T20:30:00+00:00,489 Minor Hall,,"Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Speaker/Performer: Edward S. Ruthazer,

I n 1949 Donald Hebb put forth an influential model proposing that learning may be manifested by a growth process between neuronal partners in the brain that exhibited correlated firing such that the presynaptic cell had participated in causing its postsynaptic partner to fire. The NMDA receptor has been identified as a molecular detector of correlated firing due to its voltage-dependence. Developmental refinement of neuronal circuits is also thought to exploit similar correlation-dependent mechanisms. Consistent with this idea, numerous studies have shown that NMDA receptor blockade or genetic knockout disrupts normal developmental plasticity and circuit refinement. Using a combination of targeted genetic manipulation, and time lapse imaging of axonal remodeling in response to patterned visual stimuli in vivo, we explore the contributions of correlated firing and NMDA receptors in the Xenopus retinotectal system, a classic experimental model for the study of activity-dependent visual system refinement.

Plasticity of binocularity and acuity are differentially limited by Nogo Receptor,Seminar: Oxyopia Seminar,2014-03-10T19:00:00+00:00,2014-03-10T20:30:00+00:00,489 Minor Hall,,"Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Speaker/Performer: Aaron McGee,

Why does discordant vision only during childhood induce amblyopia (lazy-eye)? Why does this disorder cause enduring visual impairment even if the underlying causes are corrected in adulthood? This is in part because experience-dependent plasticity is limited in the maturing brain by factors present in the neuropil, including myelination and the extracellular matrix. The neuronal Nogo receptor (NgR1) gene is required to close the critical period for visual plasticity. Mice lacking this gene retain developmental visual plasticity as adults and spontaneously recover normal visual acuity in a rodent model of amblyopia. We are investigating how NgR1 restricts visual plasticity with a combination of mouse genetics, electrophysiology, chronic in vivo imaging, and behavioral assays. Our preliminary result reveal that although eye dominance and acuity are both impaired by abnormal vision, the plasticity of these facets of visual function may rely on distinct cortical circuitry

Subtle alterations in how cortical network dynamics are modulated by different behavioral states could disrupt normal brain function and underlie symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders, including fragile X syndrome (FXS). Using two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology we recorded spontaneous neuronal ensemble activity in mouse somatosensory cortex. We find that unanesthetized Fmr1/ mice exhibit abnormally high synchrony of neocortical network activity. Neuronal firing rates are also 3-fold higher in Fmr1/ mice when the animals are in slow wave sleep or quiet wakefulness. Combined EEG/calcium imaging experiments confirmed that neurons in mutant mice have abnormally high firing and synchrony during sleep/rest. We conclude that cortical networks in FXS are hyperexcitable in a brain state-dependent manner during a critical period for experience-dependent plasticity. These state-dependent network defects could explain the intellectual, sleep and sensory integration dysfunctions associated with FXS.

How does the human brain use neural activity to create and represent meanings of words, sentences and stories? One way to study this question is to give peopletext to read, while scanning their brain. We have been doing such experiments with fMRI (1 mm spatial resolution) and MEG (1 msec time resolution) brain imaging. As a result, we have learned answers to questions such as ""Are the neural encodings of word meaning the same in your brain and mine?"", ""Are neural encodings of word meaning built out of recognizable subcomponents, or are they randomly different for each word?,"" and ""What sequence of neurally encoded information flows through the brain during the half-second in which the brain comprehends a word?"" This talk will summarize some of what we have learned, and newer questions we are currently working on.

Retinal Output Channels: Distinct Networks for Synching the Clock and Stabilizing the Visual World,Seminar: Oxyopia Seminar,2014-03-17T19:00:00+00:00,2014-03-17T20:30:00+00:00,489 Minor Hall,,"Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Speaker/Performer: David Berson,

Ganglion cells are the output cells of the retina; their axons form the optic nerve. These neurons are divisible into more than 20 distinct types differing in morphology and light responses. Each ganglion-cell type sends its outputs to a specific set of brain targets, presumably providing each with a pre-processed representation of the visual scene that is tailored to specific functional requirements. I will discuss recent research from my lab on two such output channels. The first comprises peculiar ganglion cells that express the photopigment melanopsin, and can thus respond directly to light. These cells play a critical role in reflexive responses to bright light, including adjustments of the circadian clock and pupil. An entirely separate retinal output channel detects the slippage of the retinal image when we move and drives compensatory image-stabilizing eye movements. Contrasts between these output channels will highlight how the requirements of visually guided behavior can inform the study of retinal cells and circuits.

Bioelectronics at the nanoscale: towards seamless integration with cells and tissue,Seminar,2014-03-17T21:00:00+00:00,2014-03-17T22:30:00+00:00,521 Cory Hall,,"Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Speaker/Performer: **Chong Xie**,

Nanostructured devices enable unique opportunities at the interface between the physical and life sciences. In this presentation, I will discuss our recent efforts on seamlessly integrating nanoelectronics with biological cells at the single-cell, cell-network and tissue levels. I will first present our nanopillar-electrode-based action potential recording platform. Action potentials play the central role in nervous and cardio systems. Traditionally, patch clamp and microelectrode array have been used to record action potentials. However, patch clamping suffers the drawback of invasiveness and low throughput, and microelectrode arrays record weak and distorted signals that are difficult to interpret. Nanopillar electrodes can afford high throughput, minimally invasive intracellular action potential recording with high signal-to-noise ratio from cultured cardiomyocytes. Extending the application of nano-devices to the tissue and in-vivo level, I will then discuss how we optimize the brain-electronic interface using nanowire-based 3D macroporous electronics. Conventional brain probes have important limitations, including recording being limited on the probe surface and chronic deterioration of the implant-tissue interface elicited by the mechanical mismatch between implants and brain tissue. I will present the design and implementation of macroporous nanoelectronic brain probes, which can overcome these limitations due to their flexibility and tissue-interpenetrating structure. These works highlight the promise of blurring the distinction between electronic and living systems, and open up significant opportunities in pharmaceutical screening, tissue engineering, brain activity mapping, and brain-machine interface.

State-dependent Networks: Timing and Computations Based on Neural Dynamics and Short-term Plasticity,Seminar: Redwood Seminar,2014-03-19T20:00:00+00:00,2014-03-19T21:30:00+00:00,560 Evans Hall,,"Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Speaker/Performer: Dean Buonomano,

The brains ability to seamlessly assimilate and process spatial and temporal information is critical to most behaviors, from understanding speech to playing the piano. Indeed, because the brain evolved to navigate a dynamic world, timing and temporal processing represent a fundamental computation. We have proposed that timing and the processing of temporal information emerges from the interaction between incoming stimuli and the internal state of neural networks. The internal state, is defined not only by ongoing activity (the active state) but by time-varying synaptic properties, such as short-term synaptic plasticity (the hidden state). One prediction of this hypothesis is that timing is a general property of cortical circuits. We provide evidence in this direction by demonstrating that in vitro cortical networks can learn simple temporal patterns. Finally, previous theoretical studies have suggested that recurrent networks capable of self-perpetuating activity hold significant computational potential. However, harnessing the computational potential of these networks has been hampered by the fact that such networks are chaotic. We show that it is possible to tame chaos through recurrent plasticity, and create a novel and powerful general framework for how cortical circuits compute.

The retina utilizes a variety of signal processing mechanisms to compute direction from image motion. The computation is accomplished by a circuit that includes starburst amacrine cells (SBACs), which are GABAergic neurons presynaptic to direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). SBACs are symmetric neurons with several branched dendrites radiating out from the soma. When a stimulus moving back and forth along a SBAC dendrite sequentially activates synaptic inputs, larger post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) are produced in the dendritic tips when the stimulus moves outwards from the soma. The directional difference in EPSP amplitude is further amplified near the dendritic tips by voltage-gated channels to produce directional release of GABA. Reciprocal inhibition between adjacent SBACs may also amplify directional release. Directional signals in the independent SBAC branches are preserved because each dendrite makes selective contacts only with DSGCs of the appropriate preferred-direction. Directional signals are further enhanced within the dendritic arbor of the DSGC, which essentially comprises an array of distinct dendritic compartments. Each of these dendritic compartments locally sum excitatory and inhibitory inputs, amplifies them with voltage-gated channels, and generates spikes that propagate to the axon via the soma. Overall, the computation of direction in the retina is performed by several local dendritic mechanisms both presynaptic and postsynaptic, with the result that directional responses are robust over a broad range of stimuli.

There has been a technological explosion underlying consumer-based visual processing initiated by recent advances in smart phone capabilities. One of the best examples of this revolution is the introduction of Google Glass, essentially a visual smart phone that can implement all of the apps now available on Android devices, and many more. The advantages of this technology can now be brought to bear on the development of visual aids for the low vision community. Low vision, either due to a foveal scotoma as in AMD or a loss of peripheral vision as in RP has been treated, historically, with a simple magnifying glass. More recently digital technology in the form of a camera feeding a computer monitor has become a prevalent technique for increasing reading capability. Smart phone technology makes possible smaller, compact portable vision aids available at lower cost that can include a variety of apps to enhance visual performance, essentially Google glasses with broad field of view. These apps include text-to-voice, Google maps, and object recognition. Many of the image processing and image enhancement regimes that are so useful in low vision aids could be directly adapted and used as the visual processing front end image transformations for optogenetic or electrical prosthetics systems used in restoring vision for the blind.

The perception of complex visual patterns emerges from neuronal activity in a cascade of areas in the primate cerebral cortex. Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) represent information about local orientation and spatial scale, but the role of the second visual area (V2) is enigmatic. We made synthetic images that contain complex features found in naturally occurring visual textures, and used them to stimulate macaque V1 and V2 neurons. Most V2 cells respond more vigorously to these stimuli than to matched control stimuli lacking naturalistic structure, while V1 cells do not. fMRI measurements in humans reveal differences in V1 and V2 responses to the same textures that are consistent with neuronal measurements in macaque. The ability of human observers to detect naturalistic structure is well predicted by the strength of the neuronal and fMRI responses in V2 but not in V1. Preliminary results suggest a further transformation of information downstream of V2, in which the representation of natural scenes becomes a more prominent driving feature of cortex. These results reveal a particular role for V2 in the representation of naturally occurring structure in visual images, and suggest ways that it begins the transformation of information about elementary visual features into the specific signals about scenes and objects that are found in areas further downstream in the visual pathway.

The amount of data in the world is increasing at incredible rates. Large-scale data has potential to transform almost every aspect of our world, from science to business; for this potential to be realized, we must turn data into insight. In this talk, I will describe two of my efforts to address this problem computationally:

The first project, Metro Maps of Information, aims to help people understand the underlying structure of complex topics, such as news stories or research areas. Metro Maps are structured summaries that can help us understand the information landscape, connect the dots between pieces of information, and uncover the big picture.

The second project proposes a framework for automatic discovery of insightful connections in data. In particular, we focus on identifying gaps in medical knowledge: our system recommends directions of research that are both novel and promising.

I will formulate both problems mathematically and provide efficient, scalable methods for solving them. User studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods help users acquire insight efficiently across multiple domains.

In this talk, we propose a general framework for topic-specific summarization of large text corpora and illustrate how it can be used for the analysis of document collections. Our framework, concise comparative summarization
(CCS), is built on sparse classification methods. It is a lightweight and flexible tool that offers a compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently in wide use and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We argue that sparse methods have much to offer for text analysis and hope CCS opens the door for a new branch of research in this important field.
Using news articles from the New York Times, we validate our tool by designing and conducting a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human understanding. We demonstrate our approach with two case studies, a media analysis of the framing of Egypt in the New York Times throughout the Arab Spring and an informal comparison of the New York Times and Wall Street Journals coverage of energy.

Overall, we find that the Lasso with L2 normalization can be effectively and usefully used to summarize large corpora, regardless of document size. Finally, I will present preliminary results in an on-going project to study the opinions of U.S. courts of appeal by using CCS in combination with LDA.

The visual encoding of 3D object orientation is critical for artificial and natural systems. Where and how the brain visually encodes 3D object orientation remains unknown, but prior studies suggest the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) may be involved. Here, we develop rigorous analytical methods for quantifying 3D orientation tuning curves, and use these tools to the study the neural coding of surface orientation. Specifically, we show that single neurons in area CIP of the rhesus macaque jointly encode the slant and tilt of a planar surface, and that across the population, the distribution of preferred slant-tilts is not statistically different from uniform. This suggests that all slant-tilt combinations are equally represented in area CIP. Furthermore, some CIP neurons are found to also represent the third rotational degree of freedom that determines the orientation of the image pattern on the planar surface. Together, the present results suggest that CIP is a critical neural locus for the encoding of all three rotational degrees of freedom specifying an objects 3D spatial orientation. This is joint work with Ari Rosenberg and Dora Angelaki at the Baylor College of Medicine.

Cyber-physical systems combine physical and software components to build systems that 
operate in the physical world . Since these systems are often safety critical, the software 
has to be certified to a high level of assurance. Such an assurance case consists of claims 
supported by arguments based on evidence. The claims, both formal and semi-formal, can either 
be derived from sub-claims by means of an inference rule, or result from the application of 
a specific tool or service like a model checker or a test coverage analyzer. SRI's Evidential 
Tool Bus (ETB) is a distributed platform for defining workflows that produce and process the 
artifacts used in an assurance case. ETB uses Datalog as its metalanguage for defining workflows 
and constructing arguments. We present the architecture and semantics of ETB and describe how 
it is being used to support the development of assurance cases for cyber-physical systems.

No term in the security industry has more FUD surrounding it than Advanced Security Threats. Indeed, the phrase has become useless for anything except selling fear. If we ever hope to actually address advanced threats then we need to sit down, peel away the FUD, and truly understand what they are. In this session Rob will do just that. Using a ""know thy enemy"" approach he will address common misconceptions, explore tactical execution, and stare down the hard realities of cyber warfare. And from that terrifying reality he will identify strategic advantages and untapped opportunities that have been hiding under all that FUD.
Rob Seger Bio:
Rob has more than 16 years of experience in the government sector specifically focusing on security projects and roles. At a very early age, he expressed a keen interest in security, and his first official job at the age of 16 was as a contractor with a government organization working on BIOS level key-loggers and now his experience extends well beyond this into a clear understanding of network-centric exploitation.
In more recent roles, he served as an NSA researcher and then as the lead network security architect for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), followed by the role of advanced threat researcher for Chickasaw National Industries. 
Most recently, he founded and served as CTO for Morta Security (financed by AndreessenHorowitz, Northwest Venture Partners, Data Collective, and Greylock.) At Morta, his responsibilities included design and execution of the Morta product that focuses on highly sophisticated and multi-faceted cyber threat detection. Palo Alto Networks acquired Morta in January, and Rob is currently serving as the lead engineer for their advanced threat solution. Rob can speak to many facets of the Cybersecurity challenges facing commercial and government institutions today.
Rob earned a BA in Philosophy from University of Maryland College Park (2002). He has been awarded two Darpa grants and been the co-author of several security papers.

A program that computes all four zeros of a real quartic polynomial, and does so well enough to be included in a Math. library, has to overcome failure modes that afflict all the obvious candidates, like
 MATLAB's roots(C) and text-book formulas centuries old. Most of those failure modes are due to roundoff. How can they be found and, preferably, overcome without carrying extravagantly high precision?

We are in the age of networks and networked systems: communication, transportation, economic, biological, healthcare, educational, human, social, web-based, etc. This evolution and reality have created unprecedented advances and are impacting every aspect of life and work. However, many of these advances, and resulting expanding markets, are critically endangered by weaknesses in security, integrity and trust. We investigate the complex and polymorphic subject of trust in these distributed systems and describe a new framework using multiple partially ordered semirings for analyzing reputation and trust establishment, dynamics as well as composite trust. This framework is inspired by thinking of trust problems as path problems in networks. Next we describe our work based on constrained coalitional games towards understanding the role of trust in collaboration and social networks. We describe several specific applications of these methods in securing distributed inference systems, sensor networks for power grids, wireless network routing protocols, distributed control systems. We close by describing challenges and future research directions.

Software obfuscation aims to make the code of a computer program ""unintelligible'' while preserving its functionality. This problem was first posed by Diffie and Hellman in 1976, and so far, most cryptographers believed that realizing obfuscation was impossible.

My research provides the first secure solution to this problem. Consequently several other long-standing open problems have been resolved. In this talk, I will describe these new developments and their implications.

The musculoskeletal system is comprised of large load bearing soft tissues that absorb and distribute the complex loads placed on the joint. The intervertebral disc is comprised of mechanically and structurally unique substructures including the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus, which function together to support and absorb spinal loads.
Disc degeneration occurs as early as the second decade of life and contributes to over $130 billion in medical costs. Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes.
Noninvasive techniques to measure internal mechanical properties will be discussed. Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion. One approach to biological repair strategies that will be discussed is to cultivate engineered tissue in vitro, permitting some elaboration of extracellular matrix for improved long-term outcome following in vivo implantation.

Theft of confidential data is prevalent. In most applications, confidential data is stored at servers. Thus, existing systems naturally try to prevent adversaries from compromising these servers. However, experience has shown that adversaries still find a way to break in and steal the data.
In this talk, I will describe a new approach to protecting data confidentiality even when attackers get access to all server data: building practical systems that compute on encrypted data without access to the decryption key. In this setting, I designed and built a database system (CryptDB), a web application platform (Mylar), and two mobile systems, as well as developed new cryptographic schemes for them. I showed that these systems support a wide range of applications with low overhead. The talk will focus primarily on CryptDB and Mylar.
My work has already had impact: Google uses CryptDBs design for their new Encrypted BigQuery service, and a medical application of Bostons Newton-Wellesley hospital is secured with Mylar. Looking forward, this approach promises to solve confidentiality problems in other settings, such as big data systems, genomics processing, and machine learning over sensitive data.

The methodology leverages message passing techniques to provide a scalable general approach with provable guarantees in consistency and convergence in a wide variety of settings.

By appealing to the small-gain theorem of one of the authors (Girard), we show that the 13-variable sodium-channel component of the IMW cardiac-cell model (Iyer-Mazhari- Winslow) can be replaced by an approximately bisimilar, 2-variable HH-type (Hodgkin-Huxley) abstraction. We show that this substitution of (approximately) equals for equals is safe in the sense that the approximation error between sodium-channel models does not get amplified by the feed-back-loop context in which it is placed. To prove this feed-back compositionality result, we exhibit quadratic-polynomial, exponentially decaying bisimulation functions between the IMW and HH-type sodium channels, and also for the IMW-based context in which these sodium-channel models are placed. These functions allow us to quantify the overall error introduced by the sodium-channel abstraction and subsequent substitution in the IMW model. To automate the computation of the bisimulation functions, we employ the SOSTOOLS optimization toolbox. Our experimental results validate our analytical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of delta-bisimilar, feedback-assisting, compositional reasoning in biological systems.

TRUST Security Seminar: Computational Jewelry for Trustworthy mHealth,Seminar,2014-03-13T21:00:00+00:00,2014-03-13T22:00:00+00:00,"Soda Hall, Wozniak Lounge",,Team for Research in Ubiquitous Secure Technology (TRUST),"Speaker/Performer: David Kotz,

The advent of mobile health (mHealth) technology brings great opportunity to improve quality of life, improve individual and public health, and reduce healthcare costs. Although mHealth devices and applications are proliferating, many challenges remain to provide the necessary usability, manageability, interoperability, availability, security, and privacy. The vision of the Amulet project is that computational jewelry, in a form like a bracelet or pendant, will provide the properties essential for successful body-area mHealth networks. These devices coordinate the activity of the body-area network and provide a discreet means for communicating with their wearer. Such devices complement the capabilities of a smartphone, bridging the gap between the type of pervasive computing possible with a mobile phone and that enabled by wearable computing.

Our interdisciplinary team of investigators is designing and developing Amulet, an electronic bracelet and a software framework that enables developers to create (and users to easily use) safe, secure, and efficient mHealth applications that fit seamlessly into everyday life. The research is determining the degree to which computational jewelry offers advantages in availability, reliability, security, privacy, and usability, and developing techniques that provide these properties in spite of the severely-constrained power resources of wearable jewelry.

The vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) is a key light source of energy-efficient and high-speed optical interconnects in data centers and supercomputers. VCSELs have also been used in absorption spectroscopy, optical PC mouse applications and local area networks and so on. VCSELs have various merits such as low power consumption, ultra-fast modulation, and low threshold current, small-footprint and low-cost in mass-fabrication. However, there still remain key challenges such as higher speed modulation of over 40 Gbps with low power consumption of below 100 fJ/bit for energy-efficient data center photonics. The resonance frequency of VCSELs determines the intrinsic modulation bandwidth of VCSELs. Since the resonance frequency increases as the square root of the drive current above threshold, high current densities may be required to increase the modulation bandwidth, which makes a difficulty in long-term reliability. Therefore it has been practically hard to go beyond 40 Gbps in conventional VCSELs.
Recently, a Photon-Photon Resonance (PPR) effect has been used in single-mode edge emitting semiconductor lasers in order to increase their 3-dB modulation bandwidths far beyond the relaxation oscillation frequency....

Mirkin,

The crystallographic parameters of atomic and ionic solids are fixed by the size and coordination number of their elemental building blocks, thus restricting the types of structures that can be formed. We have demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) as artificial atoms in nanoparticle superlattice assemblies.
These three-dimensional conjugates consist of densely functionalized, highly oriented nucleic acids covalently attached to the surface of inorganic nanoparticles. The strength and length of the programmable DNA bonds between these structures can be adjusted by varying DNA sequence and length, and the properties of the atoms can be adjusted by varying nanoparticle size, shape, and composition.
We have developed design rules for this assembly process, analogous to Paulings Rules for ionic solids but ultimately more powerful. These rules can be used as a guide for the rational construction of functional nanoparticle-based materials for plasmonic, photonic, and catalytic applications.

TITLE:
What is the Power of Groups?

ABSTRACT:
Aggregation of supply and demand-side resources at various scales has been proposed as a mechanism to manage the variability of power networks with significant penetration of renewables. In the supply-side, most studies argue for the formation of large groups of producers that compensate each other's shortfalls. In the demand-side, loads are managed as large aggregates at the unit of neighborhoods or cities. Yet, not much is known based on actual supply, demand and market data. In this talk we investigate the data-driven design of right-sized groups. In the supply-side, we formulate a Cournot competition game based on system operator market data. The resulting model demonstrates that efficient coalitions have an optimal size. In the demand-side we investigate optimal pricing for consumers utilizing hourly smart meter data from 500,000 households. We propose a simple and scalable revenue management mechanism that shows effective pricing divides customers into groups of optimal size. We conclude the talk by highlighting additional important features from data and outline some ongoing and future work. This presentation is based on joint work with Ramesh Johari, Jungsuk Kwac, Sid Patel, Raffi Sevlian and Baosen Zhang.

The latter enables us to introduce techniques from Applied Algebra (construction of specific vectors using commutative groups of operators, and Fast Fourier Transform techniques) to suggest new efficient algorithms for radar detection.

I will explain these methods, and I will demonstrate an application to the Inhomogeneous Radar Scene Problem, formulated in our interaction with engineers from General Motors (GM), who want to develop sensitive radar devices for cars.

Delivering power using Radio Frequency (RF) signals instead of ohmic conduction is changing the design of systems such as implanted medical devices, smart structures, and consumer electronics. From Eniac to today, the energy efficiency of computing has improved by a factor of one trillion; this energy scaling trend is one of the key enablers for wireless power today.

I will describe several systems my lab has developed in the course of exploring the space of wireless power techniques. WISP (Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform) is a platform for sensing and computing that is powered and read by standards-compliant UHF RFID readers. It has been used by researchers around the world for both ""perpetual sensing"" and RFID security research. Our ABC (Ambient Backscatter Communication) nodes are powered by ambient RF signals (such as TV or cell phone signals); ABC nodes communicate by reflecting pre-existing RF signals, rather than generating their own signals.

WISP and ABC operate in the far field and have power budgets of tens of microwatts. WREL (Wireless Resonant Energy Link) and FREED (Free-range Resonant Electrical Energy Delivery) operate in the near field and provide tens of watts. The FREED system powers Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs), implanted heart pumps that today require a transcutaneous power cable. I will also outline our recent projects on fully implanted ElectroCorticography and Brain-Computer-Spinal Interface. I will conclude by reflecting on changes to the design space enabled by wireless power, and discussing future directions for RF-powered sensor and actuator systems.

Our current healthcare system is belabored with significant inefficiency. This inefficiency includes poor communication among care providers, poor care coordination, poor system interoperability, and poor usability of health information systems. As each of these inefficiencies are addressed through technology such as mobile and cross organizational accesses, these solutions generate new risks to privacy, confidentiality, and security. The changing healthcare climate will be addressed with a focus on patient and provider privacy.

Microsystems have the potential to impact biology by providing new ways to manipulate cells. Simply physically manipulating cellsusing microfluidics, electric fields, or optical forcesprovides new ways to separate cells and organize cell-cell interactions.
We have been exploiting microscale electric fields to manipulate cells in a variety of ways. One example is to sort cells based on their intrinsic electrical properties, which we have applied to understand the genetic basis of electrical properties, as well as apply for point-of-care cell-based assays. Another is to use electric fields to guide the growth of axons, which we can do in 3D and in a non-contact fashion, allowing generation of topologically complex in vitro neural networks.
Together, these new microscale tools provide ways to exploit cells potential for both basic science and applied biotechnology.

The products and standards developed as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution allow small embedded devices to appear as regular Internet hosts, thereby becoming the ""fingers of the Internet"". The manufacturing sector is leading the way in adopting IoT technology, where it is being applied to energy management, building automation, and industrial process control. While most IoT solutions offer seamless integration into the Internet, many lack the reliability, security and low-power operation required by most applications. This can cause pilot deployments to exhibit poor performance and security vulnerabilities, eventually leading to an adoption rate of the IoT slower than anticipated.

To answer this situation, IoT technology adopts techniques coming from industrial networking. The networks resulting from this convergence enable data to flow over a traditional IP-based infrastructure, but exhibiting wire-like reliability, ultra-low power consumption, and the highest level of security. The resulting ""Internet of Important Things"" enables the true fusion of the cyber and physical worlds.

This presentation will show how the Internet of Important Things is a reality today. We will start by listing the challenges of building highly reliable and ultra low-power wireless mesh networks. We will then discuss the technologies which can answer this challenge, with a particular focus on channel hopping. We will illustrate this discussion through numerous examples taken from existing commercial products and deployments, and open-source implementations. We will end by introducing the work being done in the new IETF 6TiSCH working group, and highlight the associated open research problems.

Indoor positioning technology or the technique for locating a mobile user is the base technology for indoor location-aware computing. In general, there are a large variety of location-based applications and services that rely on an accurate and stable location estimation system such as warehouse management, point-of-interest, infotainment, patient monitoring, mobile healthcare, and customer/consumer behavior analysis within an enclosed area like a shopping mall or exhibition center. Such location-based services play a crucial part in enabling e-commerce, and m-commerce, and eventually a critical part to bring the community to the era of ubiquitous/pervasive computing.

In view of the heavy usage and progressively growing coverage of WLAN within the indoor environment, and the research studies on ways to do WLAN positioning and tracking, there is a need to investigate the feasibility of using the WLAN infrastructure to locate a mobile user as well as to find an efficient and effective way to track users behavior and provides location-based services in libraries, museums, shopping malls, and exhibition centers, and to ensure personal safety in hospitals and elderly centers.

This talk will focus on the technical as well as the practical issues on Wi-Fi localization and compare our proposed method with some of the classical approaches in the literature. We will also discuss about how the proposed method is to be applied to an exhibition center in tracking users behavior.

We are entering a new era of computing  the era of ubiquitous/pervasive computing where we can retrieve any data from any device using any network at anytime and anyplace, and this is the technology that will bring us a step closer to a more secure and more convenient ubiquitous computing society.

In this talk, I will discuss my lab's work in the emerging field of adversarial stylometry and machine learning. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used in security and privacy domains, in areas that go beyond intrusion or spam detection. For example, in digital forensics, questions often arise about the authors of documents: their identity, demographic background, and whether they can be linked to other documents. The field of stylometry uses linguistic features and machine learning techniques to answer these questions.
We have applied stylometry to difficult domains such as underground hacker forums, open source projects (code), and tweets. In particular, I will discuss our Doppelgänger Finder algorithm, which enables us to group Sybil accounts on underground forums and detect blogs from Twitter feeds. We also have developed a tool, Anonymouth, to help users understand their vulnerability to stylometric analysis and change their writing style.

Cancer therapy has a critical unmet need, which is to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients.
There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system.
A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy.
We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. The assay complements current genetic characterizations of tumor variation between individuals and should greatly speed up the testing of new drugs in research settings.
I will demonstrate how bringing these microfluidic devices into the clinic will greatly enabled by the use of stereolithography, a form of 3D printing.

The cell membrane is one of the most vital components of a cell; the gate-keeper into and out of the cytoplasm. Studies ranging from neural activity to drug discovery to fundamental cell physiology rely upon controlling electronic or chemical flow across this barrier.
Unfortunately, our ability to artificially control cellular access is surprisingly poor; current techniques often involve creating holes in or puncturing cell membranes that often cause rapid cell death. Yet precise, non-destructive access to the cell interior can lead to an impressive range of new techniques and devices, ranging from neural-prosthetic interfaces, electrical cell monitoring for disease, to rapid drug screening. These types of technologies are particularly important for the recently announced Brain Activity Map and for harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells as disease models and clinical indicators.

One of the critical problems is that we have little knowledge of what happens when the lipid membrane interacts with cell-penetrating materials. Here we explore how inorganic materials with nanoscale molecular functionalization influence and control this vital interface.
We discovered that by selectively tuning the hydrophobicity and flexibility of the molecular functionalization we can replicate many of the design features of natural transmembrane proteins, providing non-disruptive mechanical, electrical and chemical access into the cell. These Stealth probes spontaneously insert into lipid membrane, and form tight lipid-post junctions. Force testing with atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of interfacial adhesion, which surprisingly reveals significant adhesion energy differences between molecular groups with similar hydrophobicity but different mobility. This contradicts traditional hydrophobicity indices as indicators of molecular stability in lipid membranes.

Similarly, we achieved high-efficiency chemical delivery and control by mimicking nature gap junction proteins to create nanostraw arrays. These nanoscale (100-500 nm) diameter straws are formed based on simple water filtration membranes, and spontaneously penetrate cells plated onto them. We find these provide permanent conduits into cells, permitting delivery of a wide variety of materials that could normally not pass through the cell wall.
These two technologies are examples of how the combination of physical sciences and biology can create new beneficial devices that would not be possible in isolation.

We introduce a simple benchmark model of dynamic matching in networked markets, where agents arrive and depart stochastically and the network of acceptable transactions among agents forms a random graph. We analyze our model from three perspectives: waiting, optimization, and information. The main insight of our analysis is that waiting to thicken the market can be substantially more important than increasing the speed of transactions, and this is quite robust to the presence of waiting costs. From an optimization perspective, naive local algorithms, that choose the right time to match agents but do not exploit global network structure, can perform very close to optimal algorithms. From an information perspective, algorithms that employ even partial information on agents' departure times perform substantially better than those that lack such information. To elicit agents' departure times, we design an incentive-compatible continuous-time dynamic mechanism without transfers.

Solar energy represents a renewable source that has the potential to meet our ever-increasing energy demand without devastating the environment. One approach to harvesting the energy is to carry out light-powered chemical reactions. Thermodynamically uphill, these reactions produce energetic chemicals that can be used as fuels, promising a large-scale energy storage solution.
To enable these reactions, we need materials that can absorb light, separate charges, and catalyze specific chemistries. The materials should be made of earth-abundant elements to allow for large-scale implementations. They also need to be resistant against photo corrosion. To date, a low-cost, long-lasting material that can produce solar fuels with a high efficiency remains elusive.
In this talk, we present our efforts aimed at understanding what limits the performance of materials in solar fuel generation reactions. Within the context of photoanode and photocathode, we show how the photoelectrode properties are changed by introducing material components designed for improving charge transport, surface potential accumulation, and interface kinetics, respectively. We also demonstrate that highly complex organic molecules can be produced by photoreduction of CO2, in a fashion closely mimicking the dark reactions in natural photosynthesis.
This body of work is enabled by our ability to synthesize materials with precisely controlled surfaces and interfaces using methods such as atomic layer deposition. Our results highlight the importance of understanding thermodynamic and kinetic factors in complex systems such as that for solar fuel production separately. Detailed knowledge generated by our research contributes to the goal of realizing low-cost, high-efficiency artificial photosynthesis.

 Commissioner,

 California Public Utilities Commission
California energy policy supports an ambitious transition from conventional fossil generation to renewable and other clean resources. Low-carbon, variable and distributed generation provide many benefits to the state, but also present new circumstances for our traditional energy integration and reliability tools to respond to. Some of the resources that California is pursuing to manage this ramp are demand response, generation diversity, fast response natural gas plants, and energy storage.
This talk will discuss the tools and analytics the California Public Utilities Commission and the state are pursing to address integration and promote flexible resources. In particular, recent developments in energy storage and demand response, and the potential role for electric vehicles to provide these services, will be highlighted.

							Lund University, Sweden",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The scientific field of (compound) semiconductor nanowires got started seriously in the US and in Europe about 15 years ago, some ten years after the original break-through research conducted by Dr. Kenji Hiruma and his team at Hitachi in Japan.

Our own early work was initially very much exploratory research, testing to what extent we could understand, control and have fun with the ways in which nanowires nucleate and grow. The whole field of nanowires saw great progress in the use of nanowires for physics and for fairly simple model devices. Just in the last five, or so, years we have seen serious break-through in novel growth methods and the understanding of nanowire growth, as well as in the development of new technologies enabling efficient fabrication of nanowires for areas like solar cells and light-emitting diodes.
In this talk I will cover all these areas, with an emphasis on recent progress in controlled and efficient fabrication of nanowires for energy applications.

Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive building blocks for solar photovoltaics (PV). In this talk, I will provide an overview our ongoing efforts to design lead salt QD thin film absorbers for next-generation PV.
Basic requirements for QD absorber layers include efficient light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, and long-term stability. I will first discuss several methods used to make conductive QD films by solution deposition and ligand exchange. Studies of carrier mobility as a function of basic film parameters such as inter-QD spacing, QD size, and QD size distribution have led to a better understanding of charge transport within highly disordered QD films. Efforts to improve carrier mobility by enhancing inter-dot electronic coupling, passivating surface states, and implementing rudimentary doping will be highlighted.
Engineering the inter-QD matrix to produce QD/inorganic or QD/organic nanocomposites is introduced as a promising way to optimize coupling, remove surface states, and achieve long-term environmental stability for high-performance, robust QD films. To obtain large photocurrent from QD solar cells, it is critical to increase the minority carrier diffusion length to rival the optical absorption length, possibly by harnessing band-like transport through extended electronic states. The relative roles of superlattice order, energy disorder, and surface states in this regard will be summarized.

I n 1949 Donald Hebb put forth an influential model proposing that learning may be manifested by a growth process between neuronal partners in the brain that exhibited correlated firing such that the presynaptic cell had participated in causing its postsynaptic partner to fire. The NMDA receptor has been identified as a molecular detector of correlated firing due to its voltage-dependence. Developmental refinement of neuronal circuits is also thought to exploit similar correlation-dependent mechanisms. Consistent with this idea, numerous studies have shown that NMDA receptor blockade or genetic knockout disrupts normal developmental plasticity and circuit refinement. Using a combination of targeted genetic manipulation, and time lapse imaging of axonal remodeling in response to patterned visual stimuli in vivo, we explore the contributions of correlated firing and NMDA receptors in the Xenopus retinotectal system, a classic experimental model for the study of activity-dependent visual system refinement.

Stem cells offer tremendous promise as the basis of regenerative therapies due to their inherent capacity for differentiation into various cell types and their potent ability to secrete a unique cadre of morphogenic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory factors. Engineering the properties of 3D stem cell microenvironments offers a means of regulating their fate and function in an analogous format to the multicellular organization of primitive developing tissues. Simple multicellular aggregates of stem cells permit differentiation and morphogenesis of complex tissue structures, as demonstrated by numerous recent organoid examples, and are directly amenable to scalable suspension culture techniques. Thus, we have taken a systematic approach to the engineering of pluripotent and multipotent stem cell aggregates in order to examine the effects of biophysical and biochemical cues on cell fate, morphogenesis, and secretory function for the purposes of creating in vitro model systems, developing scalable biomanufacturing technologies, and directing innate trophic delivery and regenerative potential. We have demonstrated through a series of studies that hydrodynamic forces created within mixed suspension culture can modulate differentiation and extracellular matrix and growth factor expression of homogeneous populations of pluripotent stem cell aggregates. We have also pioneered the incorporation of different types of biomaterials within 3D aggregates of stem cells as a means of spatiotemporally controlling the delivery of exogenous factors and sequestering of endogenous morphogens that impact stem cell phenotype. More recently we have developed quantitative analytical methods and computational modeling approaches to assess the cellular composition, mechanical properties and patterns of differentiation within single aggregates to complement our experimental efforts to dissect the mechanisms regulating stem cell fate decisions. The sum of these strategies is intended to enhance our understanding of the governing principles dictating stem cell morphogenesis and ultimately translate the potential of stem cells into viable cell-based therapies and diagnostics that transform the future of biomedical research and healthcare practices.

The musculoskeletal system is comprised of large load bearing soft tissues that absorb and distribute the complex loads placed on the joint. The intervertebral disc is comprised of mechanically and structurally unique substructures including the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus, which function together to support and absorb spinal loads.
Disc degeneration occurs as early as the second decade of life and contributes to over $130 billion in medical costs. Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes.
Noninvasive techniques to measure internal mechanical properties will be discussed. Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion. One approach to biological repair strategies that will be discussed is to cultivate engineered tissue in vitro, permitting some elaboration of extracellular matrix for improved long-term outcome following in vivo implantation.

Plasticity of binocularity and acuity are differentially limited by Nogo Receptor,Seminar: Seminars of interest,2014-03-10T19:00:00+00:00,2014-03-10T20:30:00+00:00,489 Minor Hall,,"Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Speaker/Performer: Aaron McGee,

Why does discordant vision only during childhood induce amblyopia (lazy-eye)? Why does this disorder cause enduring visual impairment even if the underlying causes are corrected in adulthood? This is in part because experience-dependent plasticity is limited in the maturing brain by factors present in the neuropil, including myelination and the extracellular matrix. The neuronal Nogo receptor (NgR1) gene is required to close the critical period for visual plasticity. Mice lacking this gene retain developmental visual plasticity as adults and spontaneously recover normal visual acuity in a rodent model of amblyopia. We are investigating how NgR1 restricts visual plasticity with a combination of mouse genetics, electrophysiology, chronic in vivo imaging, and behavioral assays. Our preliminary result reveal that although eye dominance and acuity are both impaired by abnormal vision, the plasticity of these facets of visual function may rely on distinct cortical circuitry

This talk will describe our efforts to interface bioactive molecules with nanomaterials and nanoscale scaffolds for designing potent therapeutics and functional nanocomposites.

The design of polyvalent molecules presenting multiple copies of a specific ligand represents a promising strategy to inhibit pathogens and bacterial toxins. We will first describe the design of polyvalent inhibitors that are orders of magnitude more active than the corresponding monovalent molecules and can neutralize anthrax toxin in vivo. We recently described a thermodynamic analysis to help clarify the theoretical basis for the large enhancements in avidity due to polyvalency. We have used this understanding to guide the structure-based design of potent synthetic polyvalent ligands. The ability to control independently the valency and the spacing between ligands is particularly valuable for these design efforts. To that end, we recently designed monodisperse polypeptide-based polyvalent inhibitors of anthrax toxin in which multiple copies of an inhibitory toxin-binding peptide were separated by flexible peptide linkers. By tuning the valency and linker length, we designed polyvalent inhibitors that were over four orders of magnitude more potent than the corresponding monovalent ligands. Studies relating the composition and structure of polyvalent inhibitors to their activity have also shed light on fundamental aspects of polyvalent recognition, including the role of pattern matching. We will also discuss other applications of polyvalent molecules ranging from the inhibition of pathogens (e.g., the influenza virus) to controlling the nanoscale organization of cellular receptors to regulate signaling and stem cell fate.
In addition to the inhibition of bacterial toxins, we are also investigating approaches to target pathogenic bacteria. In particular, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has been a growing concern. We have been exploring an enzyme-based approach to combat pathogenic bacteria. We will describe an approach that we have developed to identify novel bacteriolytic enzymes targeting a variety of bacterial pathogens. We have also investigated the structure and function of these and other enzymes when immobilized onto nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes. Our studies indicate that the nanoscale environment can significantly influence the activity and stability of these proteins. We have used the highly stable and active nanomaterial-protein conjugates to form nanocomposite films that are effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).

The crystallographic parameters of atomic and ionic solids are fixed by the size and coordination number of their elemental building blocks, thus restricting the types of structures that can be formed. We have demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) as artificial atoms in nanoparticle superlattice assemblies.
These three-dimensional conjugates consist of densely functionalized, highly oriented nucleic acids covalently attached to the surface of inorganic nanoparticles. The strength and length of the programmable DNA bonds between these structures can be adjusted by varying DNA sequence and length, and the properties of the atoms can be adjusted by varying nanoparticle size, shape, and composition.
We have developed design rules for this assembly process, analogous to Paulings Rules for ionic solids but ultimately more powerful. These rules can be used as a guide for the rational construction of functional nanoparticle-based materials for plasmonic, photonic, and catalytic applications.

Microsystems have the potential to impact biology by providing new ways to manipulate cells. Simply physically manipulating cellsusing microfluidics, electric fields, or optical forcesprovides new ways to separate cells and organize cell-cell interactions.
We have been exploiting microscale electric fields to manipulate cells in a variety of ways. One example is to sort cells based on their intrinsic electrical properties, which we have applied to understand the genetic basis of electrical properties, as well as apply for point-of-care cell-based assays. Another is to use electric fields to guide the growth of axons, which we can do in 3D and in a non-contact fashion, allowing generation of topologically complex in vitro neural networks.
Together, these new microscale tools provide ways to exploit cells potential for both basic science and applied biotechnology.

Cancer therapy has a critical unmet need, which is to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients.
There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system.
A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy.
We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. The assay complements current genetic characterizations of tumor variation between individuals and should greatly speed up the testing of new drugs in research settings.
I will demonstrate how bringing these microfluidic devices into the clinic will greatly enabled by the use of stereolithography, a form of 3D printing.

Malaria is a serious health risk in tropical West Africa. In Ghana, where these bitter roots became known as Ghana Quinine, a group of African scientists devoted their lives to creating a patented pharmaceutical from the plant. I consider their interactions with traditional healers from the 1940s, their struggles to establish a fledgling pharmaceutical industry, and the conflicts that complicated the success of the new drug in this postcolonial nation. This little known historical case provides a window into recent controversies surrounding biodiversity prospecting in tropical environments, the rights of indigenous peoples to shared benefits, and the quest for pharmaceutical patents.

The cell membrane is one of the most vital components of a cell; the gate-keeper into and out of the cytoplasm. Studies ranging from neural activity to drug discovery to fundamental cell physiology rely upon controlling electronic or chemical flow across this barrier.
Unfortunately, our ability to artificially control cellular access is surprisingly poor; current techniques often involve creating holes in or puncturing cell membranes that often cause rapid cell death. Yet precise, non-destructive access to the cell interior can lead to an impressive range of new techniques and devices, ranging from neural-prosthetic interfaces, electrical cell monitoring for disease, to rapid drug screening. These types of technologies are particularly important for the recently announced Brain Activity Map and for harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells as disease models and clinical indicators.

One of the critical problems is that we have little knowledge of what happens when the lipid membrane interacts with cell-penetrating materials. Here we explore how inorganic materials with nanoscale molecular functionalization influence and control this vital interface.
We discovered that by selectively tuning the hydrophobicity and flexibility of the molecular functionalization we can replicate many of the design features of natural transmembrane proteins, providing non-disruptive mechanical, electrical and chemical access into the cell. These Stealth probes spontaneously insert into lipid membrane, and form tight lipid-post junctions. Force testing with atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of interfacial adhesion, which surprisingly reveals significant adhesion energy differences between molecular groups with similar hydrophobicity but different mobility. This contradicts traditional hydrophobicity indices as indicators of molecular stability in lipid membranes.

Similarly, we achieved high-efficiency chemical delivery and control by mimicking nature gap junction proteins to create nanostraw arrays. These nanoscale (100-500 nm) diameter straws are formed based on simple water filtration membranes, and spontaneously penetrate cells plated onto them. We find these provide permanent conduits into cells, permitting delivery of a wide variety of materials that could normally not pass through the cell wall.
These two technologies are examples of how the combination of physical sciences and biology can create new beneficial devices that would not be possible in isolation.

Solar energy represents a renewable source that has the potential to meet our ever-increasing energy demand without devastating the environment. One approach to harvesting the energy is to carry out light-powered chemical reactions. Thermodynamically uphill, these reactions produce energetic chemicals that can be used as fuels, promising a large-scale energy storage solution.
To enable these reactions, we need materials that can absorb light, separate charges, and catalyze specific chemistries. The materials should be made of earth-abundant elements to allow for large-scale implementations. They also need to be resistant against photo corrosion. To date, a low-cost, long-lasting material that can produce solar fuels with a high efficiency remains elusive.
In this talk, we present our efforts aimed at understanding what limits the performance of materials in solar fuel generation reactions. Within the context of photoanode and photocathode, we show how the photoelectrode properties are changed by introducing material components designed for improving charge transport, surface potential accumulation, and interface kinetics, respectively. We also demonstrate that highly complex organic molecules can be produced by photoreduction of CO2, in a fashion closely mimicking the dark reactions in natural photosynthesis.
This body of work is enabled by our ability to synthesize materials with precisely controlled surfaces and interfaces using methods such as atomic layer deposition. Our results highlight the importance of understanding thermodynamic and kinetic factors in complex systems such as that for solar fuel production separately. Detailed knowledge generated by our research contributes to the goal of realizing low-cost, high-efficiency artificial photosynthesis.

My lab is interested in understanding how motile cells generate and orient cell polarity. The first portion of my talk focuses on the role of mechanotransduction in cell polarity. By using a combination of mathematical modeling, alterations to cell shape, cell severing, and mechanical perturbations, we refute the dominant models of how protrusions compete with one another to generate cell polarity in neutrophils. Surprisingly, tension in the plasma membrane is the long-range inhibitor that enables cells to restrict activity to a single leading edge. This represents a fundamental shift from previous models in the field, which have focused on long-range movement of molecules for transmitting information across the cell. The second portion of my talk focuses on our recent advances in optogenetics. We have used these tools to dissect how the magnitude and timing, and spatial dynamics of intracellular protein activation are decoded by cellular signaling cascades, with a focus on Ras and PI3K signaling.We also use light for precisely tunable loss-of-function perturbations by sequestering proteins away from their normal site of action for rapid, reversible, and titratable inhibition of protein function. These tools enable a new generation of precision perturbative experiments that could revolutionize our understanding of biological systems.

Our own early work was initially very much exploratory research, testing to what extent we could understand, control and have fun with the ways in which nanowires nucleate and grow. The whole field of nanowires saw great progress in the use of nanowires for physics and for fairly simple model devices. Just in the last five, or so, years we have seen serious break-through in novel growth methods and the understanding of nanowire growth, as well as in the development of new technologies enabling efficient fabrication of nanowires for areas like solar cells and light-emitting diodes.
In this talk I will cover all these areas, with an emphasis on recent progress in controlled and efficient fabrication of nanowires for energy applications.

Developing Quantum Dot Solids for Thin-Film Photovoltaics: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar: Seminars of interest,2014-05-02T22:00:00+00:00,2014-05-02T23:00:00+00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,,Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"Speaker/Performer: Prof. Matt Law,

Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive building blocks for solar photovoltaics (PV). In this talk, I will provide an overview our ongoing efforts to design lead salt QD thin film absorbers for next-generation PV.
Basic requirements for QD absorber layers include efficient light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, and long-term stability. I will first discuss several methods used to make conductive QD films by solution deposition and ligand exchange. Studies of carrier mobility as a function of basic film parameters such as inter-QD spacing, QD size, and QD size distribution have led to a better understanding of charge transport within highly disordered QD films. Efforts to improve carrier mobility by enhancing inter-dot electronic coupling, passivating surface states, and implementing rudimentary doping will be highlighted.
Engineering the inter-QD matrix to produce QD/inorganic or QD/organic nanocomposites is introduced as a promising way to optimize coupling, remove surface states, and achieve long-term environmental stability for high-performance, robust QD films. To obtain large photocurrent from QD solar cells, it is critical to increase the minority carrier diffusion length to rival the optical absorption length, possibly by harnessing band-like transport through extended electronic states. The relative roles of superlattice order, energy disorder, and surface states in this regard will be summarized.
The talk will conclude with comments on the prospects for controlled doping and rational p-n junction formation in QD systems.

An even stronger effect occurs when graphene is fluorinated, an effect which can be interpreted in the context of the classical Prandti-Tomlinson model of stick-slip friction. I will then discuss the characterization of wear with unprecedented resolution using in-situ tests inside of a transmission electron microscope. For silicon slid against diamond, the shape evolution and volume loss due to wear closely fit a kinetic model based on stress-assisted bonding mechanisms. This allows new insights to be gained about the kinetics of atomic-scale wear.

In this talk, we propose a general framework for topic-specific summarization of large text corpora and illustrate how it can be used for the analysis of document collections. Our framework, concise comparative summarization
(CCS), is built on sparse classification methods. It is a lightweight and flexible tool that offers a compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently in wide use and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We argue that sparse methods have much to offer for text analysis and hope CCS opens the door for a new branch of research in this important field.
Using news articles from the New York Times, we validate our tool by designing and conducting a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human understanding. We demonstrate our approach with two case studies, a media analysis of the framing of Egypt in the New York Times throughout the Arab Spring and an informal comparison of the New York Times and Wall Street Journals coverage of energy.

Overall, we find that the Lasso with L2 normalization can be effectively and usefully used to summarize large corpora, regardless of document size. Finally, I will present preliminary results in an on-going project to study the opinions of U.S. courts of appeal by using CCS in combination with LDA.

To describe the stochastic environment in descriptive or prescriptive models, it is implicitly assumed that enough data will be available to guarantee the validity of a decision or the consistency of a statistical estimate. Unfortunately, in a real life environment the data

available is rarely enough to reach the asymptotic range, either

because it is not available or there is not enough time to collect an

adequate database before decisions or estimates must be produced.

One serious shortcoming is our ability to systematically blend data and

non data information, in other words, our inability to deal with the

fusion of hard and soft information. The lecture deals with these

challenges and how optimization technology can be surprisingly

effective in this context.

Suppose we do not impose stochastic models on how stock prices will evolve in the future. Is it possible, by active trading, to do better than a market index (say, S&P 
500)? The answer to this question is surprisingly tight. If we restrict ourselves to strategies that are functions of the current stock prices, there is exactly one class of trading strategies that achieves this goal. More remarkably, these strategies are produced as solutions of Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem on the multidimensional unit simplex with a cost function that can be described as the log partition function. The ideas are an interplay between convex analysis, probability theory, and the geometry of the unit simplex. We will also show how this theory explains the presence of statistical arbitrage in high-frequency trading. Based on joint work with Leonard Wong.

In this talk we show how the limiting behavior of large networks can be exploited for nonparametric statistical inference. We introduce the notion of a network histogram, obtained by fitting a stochastic blockmodel to a single observation of a network dataset. Blocks of edges play the role of histogram bins, and community sizes that of histogram bandwidths or bin sizes. Working within the framework of exchangeable arrays subject to bond percolation, we prove consistency of network histogram estimation under general conditions, giving rates of convergence which include the important practical setting of sparse networks.

We will exploit a well-known connection (Bertoin, Le Gall '06) between critical continuous-state branching processes (CSBP) that are absorbed at $0$ and the generalized Smoluchowski coagulation equation to prove a variety of limit theorems. We establish a fundamental connection between the existence of a non-degenerate scaling limit and regular variation (at $0$) of the branching mechanism. In particular, we show:

 1. A non-degenerate scaling limit of a critical CSBP (absorbed at $0$) exists if and only if the branching mechanism is regularly varying at 0.
 2. The CDF of the rescaled process conditioned on survival has a nondegenerate limit if and only if the branching mechanism is regularly at $0$.
When the scaling limits exist, we can further characterise the nondegenerate scaling limits of arbitrary finite-measure solutions in terms of generalized Mittag-Leffler series.

Models based on potential outcomes, also known as counterfactuals, were introduced by Neyman (1923) and later applied to observational contexts by Rubin (1974). Such models are now used extensively within Biostatistics, Statistics, Political Science, Economics, and Epidemiology for reasoning about causation. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), introduced by Wright (1921) are another formalism used to represent causal systems. Graphs are also extensively used in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Sociology and Epidemiology.

In this talk, I will present a simple approach to unifying these two frameworks via a new graph, termed the Single-World Intervention Graph (SWIG). The SWIG encodes the counterfactual independencies associated with a specific hypothetical intervention on a set of treatment variables. The nodes on the SWIG are the corresponding counterfactual random variables. The SWIG is derived from a causal DAG via a simple node splitting transformation. I will illustrate the theory with a number of examples. Finally I show that SWIGs avoid a number of pitfalls that are present in an alternative approach to unification, based on twin networks that has been advocated by Pearl (2000).

"Combinatorial Algorithms for the Markov Random Fields problem and implications for ranking, clustering, group decision making and image segmentation",Seminar: Other Related Seminars,2014-03-18T00:00:00+00:00,2014-03-18T01:00:00+00:00,3108 Etcheverry Hall,,Industrial Engineering & Operations Research,"Speaker/Performer: Dorit Hochbaum,

One of the classical optimization models for image segmentation is the well-known Markov Random Fields (MRF) model. The MRF problem involves minimizing pairwise-separation and singleton-deviation terms. This model is shown here to be powerful in representing classical problems of ranking, group decision making and clustering. The techniques presented are stronger than continuous techniques used in image segmentation, such as total variations, denoising, level sets and some classes of Mumford-Shah functionals. This is manifested both in terms of running time and in terms of quality of solution for the prescribed optimization problem.
We present the first known efficient, and flow-based, algorithms for the convex MRF (the non-convex is shown to be NP-hard). We then discuss the power of the MRF model and algorithms in the context of aggregate ranking. The aggregate ranking problem is to obtain a ranking that is fair and representative of the individual decision makers' rankings. We argue here that using cardinal pairwise comparisons provides several advantages over score-wise or ordinal models. The aggregate group ranking problem is formalized as the MRF model and is linked to the inverse equal paths problem. This combinatorial approach is shown to have advantages over other pairwise-based methods for ranking, such as PageRank and the principal eigenvector technique.

Neyman Seminar - Identifying Gene Interactions and Functional Groups Using Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis with Resampling,Seminar: Neyman Seminar,2014-03-19T21:00:00+00:00,2014-03-19T22:00:00+00:00,1011 Evans Hall,,Department of Statistics,"Speaker/Performer: Haiyan Huang,

 University of California, Berkeley
Identifying gene interactions has been one of the major tasks in understanding biological
processes. However, due to the difficulty in characterizing/inferring different types of
biological gene relationships, as well as several computational issues arising from dealing
with high‐dimensional biological data, finding groups of interacting genes remains
challenging. In this work we elucidate higher‐level gene‐gene interactions (i.e., gene
group interactions) by evaluating conditional dependencies between genes, i.e., the
relationships between genes after removing the influences of a set of other functionally
related genes. The detailed technique involves performing sparse canonical correlation
analysis with repeated subsampling and random partition. This technique is especially
unique and powerful in evaluating conditional dependencies when the correct
dependent sets are unknown or only partially known. When used effectively, this is a
promising technique to recover gene relationships that would have otherwise been
missed by standard methods. In addition, comparisons with other methods using

Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in computer
science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will likely lead to a
new wave of technological innovations in communication, computation and cryptography.
As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally stochastic, randomness and
uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum
information. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum computation and
quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to revolutionize computational statistics. 
This talk will give a brief review on quantum computation, introduce quantum tomography and 
compressed sensing and present my recent work on their statistical connections.

Neyman Seminar - Doubly Spectral Analysis of Functional Time Series and the Molecular Dynamics of DNA,Seminar: Neyman Seminar,2014-04-30T21:00:00+00:00,2014-04-30T22:00:00+00:00,1011 Evans Hall,,Department of Statistics,"Speaker/Performer: Victor Panaretos,

The Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansion has evolved into the workhorse of functional data analysis: the Fourier representation it affords on the one hand serves as a basis for motivating methodology by analogy to multivariate statistics; and, on the other hand, appears as the natural means of regularization in problems such as regression, testing and prediction, which are ill-posed in the functional case. With the aim of obtaining a similarly canonical representation of dependent functional data, we develop a doubly spectral analysis of a stationary functional stochastic process, decomposing it into an integral of uncorrelated functional frequency components (Cramér representation), each of which is in turn expanded into a KL series. This Cramér-Karhunen-Loève representation separates temporal from intrinsic curve variation, and it is seen to yield a harmonic principal component analysis when truncated: a finite dimensional proxy of the time series that optimally captures both within and between curve variation. Empirical versions are introduced, and a rigorous analysis of their large-sample behaviour is provided under Brillinger-type mixing conditions. Our work is motivated by and applied to the study of the molecular dynamics of short strands of DNA; specifically, we consider the problem of determining whether the dynamics of such strands in solution are significantly affected by small perturbations of their base-pair composition, based on molecular dynamics simulations. (Based on joint work with S. Tavakoli, EPFL).

The musculoskeletal system is comprised of large load bearing soft tissues that absorb and distribute the complex loads placed on the joint. The intervertebral disc is comprised of mechanically and structurally unique substructures including the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus, which function together to support and absorb spinal loads.
Disc degeneration occurs as early as the second decade of life and contributes to over $130 billion in medical costs. Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes.
Noninvasive techniques to measure internal mechanical properties will be discussed. Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion. One approach to biological repair strategies that will be discussed is to cultivate engineered tissue in vitro, permitting some elaboration of extracellular matrix for improved long-term outcome following in vivo implantation.

The crystallographic parameters of atomic and ionic solids are fixed by the size and coordination number of their elemental building blocks, thus restricting the types of structures that can be formed. We have demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) as artificial atoms in nanoparticle superlattice assemblies.
These three-dimensional conjugates consist of densely functionalized, highly oriented nucleic acids covalently attached to the surface of inorganic nanoparticles. The strength and length of the programmable DNA bonds between these structures can be adjusted by varying DNA sequence and length, and the properties of the atoms can be adjusted by varying nanoparticle size, shape, and composition.
We have developed design rules for this assembly process, analogous to Paulings Rules for ionic solids but ultimately more powerful. These rules can be used as a guide for the rational construction of functional nanoparticle-based materials for plasmonic, photonic, and catalytic applications.

Understanding the insertion of lithium into silicon electrodes for high capacity lithium-ion batteries is likely to have benefits for mobile energy storage, for both electronics and transportation. Silicon nanostructures have proven to be attractive candidates for electrodes because they provide less constraint on the volume changes that occur and more resistance to fracture during lithium insertion. But still, facture can occur even in nanostructured silicon. Here, we consider the fracture of Si nanopillars during lithiation and find surprising results. We find that fracture is initiated at the surfaces of the crystalline nanopillars and not in the interior, as had been predicted by analyses based on diffusion-induced stresses. In situ transmission electron microscopy observations of initially crystalline Si nanoparticles shows that lithiation occurs by the growth of an amorphous lithiated shell, subjected to tension, at the expense of a crystalline Si core, subjected to compression. We also show that the expansion of the nanopillars is highly anisotropic and that the fracture locations are also anisotropic. In addition, we find a critical fracture diameter for initially crystalline nanopillars of about 300nm that appears to depend on the electrochemical reaction rate. Modeling the stress evolution in Si nanopillars during lithiation provides a way to understand and control these failure processes. Also, we show that initially amorphous Si nanopillars are much more resistant to failure, having much larger critical fracture diameters, because the initial stresses at the surface are compressive in this situation compared to tension in the case of initially crystalline nanopillars. For sufficiently big amorphous Si nanopillars, cracking is expected to be initiated in the interior based on diffusion-induced stresses, but we have not yet observed this kind of fracture. The modeling we, and others, have done has been based largely on estimates or guesses about the mechanical properties of lithiated Si. Recent nanoindentation experiments show that the elastic modulus and hardness of lithiated amorphous Si depend strongly on the lithium content and also show very significant creep effects. These more subtle effects may need to be included in future modeling. It is hoped that these studies will be useful in the design of silicon electrodes for advanced battery systems.

Microsystems have the potential to impact biology by providing new ways to manipulate cells. Simply physically manipulating cellsusing microfluidics, electric fields, or optical forcesprovides new ways to separate cells and organize cell-cell interactions.
We have been exploiting microscale electric fields to manipulate cells in a variety of ways. One example is to sort cells based on their intrinsic electrical properties, which we have applied to understand the genetic basis of electrical properties, as well as apply for point-of-care cell-based assays. Another is to use electric fields to guide the growth of axons, which we can do in 3D and in a non-contact fashion, allowing generation of topologically complex in vitro neural networks.
Together, these new microscale tools provide ways to exploit cells potential for both basic science and applied biotechnology.

Cancer therapy has a critical unmet need, which is to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients.
There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system.
A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy.
We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. The assay complements current genetic characterizations of tumor variation between individuals and should greatly speed up the testing of new drugs in research settings.
I will demonstrate how bringing these microfluidic devices into the clinic will greatly enabled by the use of stereolithography, a form of 3D printing.

The cell membrane is one of the most vital components of a cell; the gate-keeper into and out of the cytoplasm. Studies ranging from neural activity to drug discovery to fundamental cell physiology rely upon controlling electronic or chemical flow across this barrier.
Unfortunately, our ability to artificially control cellular access is surprisingly poor; current techniques often involve creating holes in or puncturing cell membranes that often cause rapid cell death. Yet precise, non-destructive access to the cell interior can lead to an impressive range of new techniques and devices, ranging from neural-prosthetic interfaces, electrical cell monitoring for disease, to rapid drug screening. These types of technologies are particularly important for the recently announced Brain Activity Map and for harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells as disease models and clinical indicators.

One of the critical problems is that we have little knowledge of what happens when the lipid membrane interacts with cell-penetrating materials. Here we explore how inorganic materials with nanoscale molecular functionalization influence and control this vital interface.
We discovered that by selectively tuning the hydrophobicity and flexibility of the molecular functionalization we can replicate many of the design features of natural transmembrane proteins, providing non-disruptive mechanical, electrical and chemical access into the cell. These Stealth probes spontaneously insert into lipid membrane, and form tight lipid-post junctions. Force testing with atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of interfacial adhesion, which surprisingly reveals significant adhesion energy differences between molecular groups with similar hydrophobicity but different mobility. This contradicts traditional hydrophobicity indices as indicators of molecular stability in lipid membranes.

Similarly, we achieved high-efficiency chemical delivery and control by mimicking nature gap junction proteins to create nanostraw arrays. These nanoscale (100-500 nm) diameter straws are formed based on simple water filtration membranes, and spontaneously penetrate cells plated onto them. We find these provide permanent conduits into cells, permitting delivery of a wide variety of materials that could normally not pass through the cell wall.
These two technologies are examples of how the combination of physical sciences and biology can create new beneficial devices that would not be possible in isolation.

Solar energy represents a renewable source that has the potential to meet our ever-increasing energy demand without devastating the environment. One approach to harvesting the energy is to carry out light-powered chemical reactions. Thermodynamically uphill, these reactions produce energetic chemicals that can be used as fuels, promising a large-scale energy storage solution.
To enable these reactions, we need materials that can absorb light, separate charges, and catalyze specific chemistries. The materials should be made of earth-abundant elements to allow for large-scale implementations. They also need to be resistant against photo corrosion. To date, a low-cost, long-lasting material that can produce solar fuels with a high efficiency remains elusive.
In this talk, we present our efforts aimed at understanding what limits the performance of materials in solar fuel generation reactions. Within the context of photoanode and photocathode, we show how the photoelectrode properties are changed by introducing material components designed for improving charge transport, surface potential accumulation, and interface kinetics, respectively. We also demonstrate that highly complex organic molecules can be produced by photoreduction of CO2, in a fashion closely mimicking the dark reactions in natural photosynthesis.
This body of work is enabled by our ability to synthesize materials with precisely controlled surfaces and interfaces using methods such as atomic layer deposition. Our results highlight the importance of understanding thermodynamic and kinetic factors in complex systems such as that for solar fuel production separately. Detailed knowledge generated by our research contributes to the goal of realizing low-cost, high-efficiency artificial photosynthesis.

Recent Progress with Nanowires: Growth and Energy Applications: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-04-25T22:00:00+00:00,2014-04-25T23:00:00+00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,"Prof. Lars Samuelson, Nano Structure Consortium Founder,

							Lund University, Sweden",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The scientific field of (compound) semiconductor nanowires got started seriously in the US and in Europe about 15 years ago, some ten years after the original break-through research conducted by Dr. Kenji Hiruma and his team at Hitachi in Japan.

Our own early work was initially very much exploratory research, testing to what extent we could understand, control and have fun with the ways in which nanowires nucleate and grow. The whole field of nanowires saw great progress in the use of nanowires for physics and for fairly simple model devices. Just in the last five, or so, years we have seen serious break-through in novel growth methods and the understanding of nanowire growth, as well as in the development of new technologies enabling efficient fabrication of nanowires for areas like solar cells and light-emitting diodes.
In this talk I will cover all these areas, with an emphasis on recent progress in controlled and efficient fabrication of nanowires for energy applications.

Developing Quantum Dot Solids for Thin-Film Photovoltaics: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-05-02T22:00:00+00:00,2014-05-02T23:00:00+00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,,Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"Speaker/Performer: Prof. Matt Law,

Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive building blocks for solar photovoltaics (PV). In this talk, I will provide an overview our ongoing efforts to design lead salt QD thin film absorbers for next-generation PV.
Basic requirements for QD absorber layers include efficient light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, and long-term stability. I will first discuss several methods used to make conductive QD films by solution deposition and ligand exchange. Studies of carrier mobility as a function of basic film parameters such as inter-QD spacing, QD size, and QD size distribution have led to a better understanding of charge transport within highly disordered QD films. Efforts to improve carrier mobility by enhancing inter-dot electronic coupling, passivating surface states, and implementing rudimentary doping will be highlighted.
Engineering the inter-QD matrix to produce QD/inorganic or QD/organic nanocomposites is introduced as a promising way to optimize coupling, remove surface states, and achieve long-term environmental stability for high-performance, robust QD films. To obtain large photocurrent from QD solar cells, it is critical to increase the minority carrier diffusion length to rival the optical absorption length, possibly by harnessing band-like transport through extended electronic states. The relative roles of superlattice order, energy disorder, and surface states in this regard will be summarized.
The talk will conclude with comments on the prospects for controlled doping and rational p-n junction formation in QD systems.

To what extent does ""false science"" impact the rate and direction of scientific change? We examine the impact of more than 1,100 scientific retractions on the citation trajectories of articles that are close neighbors of retracted articles in intellectual space but were published prior to the retraction event. Our results indicate that following retraction and relative to carefully selected controls, related articles experience a lasting five to ten percent decline in the rate at which they are cited. We probe the mechanisms that might underlie these negative spillovers over intellectual space. One view holds that adjacent fields atrophy post-retraction because the shoulders they offer to follow-on researchers have been proven to be shaky or absent. An alternative view holds that scientists avoid the ""infected"" fields lest their own status suffers through mere association. Two pieces of evidence are consistent with the latter view. First, for-profit citers are much less responsive to the retraction event than are academic citers. Second, the penalty suffered by related articles is much more severe when the associated retracted article includes fraud or misconduct, relative to cases where the retraction occurred because of honest mistakes.

We introduce a simple benchmark model of dynamic matching in networked markets, where agents arrive and depart stochastically and the network of acceptable transactions among agents forms a random graph. We analyze our model from three perspectives: waiting, optimization, and information. The main insight of our analysis is that waiting to thicken the market can be substantially more important than increasing the speed of transactions, and this is quite robust to the presence of waiting costs. From an optimization perspective, naive local algorithms, that choose the right time to match agents but do not exploit global network structure, can perform very close to optimal algorithms. From an information perspective, algorithms that employ even partial information on agents' departure times perform substantially better than those that lack such information. To elicit agents' departure times, we design an incentive-compatible continuous-time dynamic mechanism without transfers.

We show that reducing social interaction increases the diversity of products purchased by consumers in two retail settings. First, we consider a field experiment conducted by Sweden's monopoly alcohol retailer and find that moving purchases from behind the counter to self-service disproportionately increases the sales of difficult-to-to-pronounce products. Second, we use individual-level panel data from a pizza delivery restaurant to show that online orders have more complexity, calories, and diversity, and measure the consequences for consumer and producer surplus. Combined, these results suggest that social frictions can substantially affect market outcomes.

"Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans from the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo, 1923",Film - Documentary,2014-03-04T00:00:00+00:00,2014-03-04T01:00:00+00:00,"Institute of East Asian Studies (2223 Fulton, 6th Floor)","Jinhee Lee,
							Associate Professor of History,

							Eastern Illinois University",Center for Korean Studies (CKS),"In 1923, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake shook Tokyo and Yokohoma, essentially leveling Japans two largest cities and causing more than 100,000 deaths. The subsequent aftershocks, fires, and ensuing panic bred rumors that malcontent Koreans living in Japan were setting the fires, poisoning water wells, and plotting a revolution. To prevent this alleged uprising, vigilantes along with police and the military massacred more than 6,000 Koreans.

Partly to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the massacre, two unreleased rare documentaries from Japan have been touring the United States since last September. The films feature interviews with Japanese and Korean survivors, and the first of the two sequel films ""Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans From the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo, 1923 will be shown. The movie was directed by Choonkong Oh, a Korean resident of Japan, and is in Japanese and Korean with English subtitles.

The documentary is under an hour long, and will be followed by a discussion featuring Jinhee Lee, a history professor at Eastern Illinois University whose research focuses on the competing narratives of collective violence in the Japanese empire.

 Stanford University
The Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society is recruiting a new faculty member for the Health Disparities Cluster.
Please join us for Professor Angela Garcia's lecture discussing her work on March 3rd, 2014, from 4-6PM, at 554 Barrows Hall.
Angela Garcias work engages historical and institutional processes through which violence and suffering is produced and lived. A central theme is the disproportionate burden of addiction, depression and incarceration among poor families and communities. Professor Garcias book, The Pastoral Clinic: Addiction and Dispossession Along The Rio Grande (University of California Press, 2010) received the 2012 Victor Turner Prize and a 2010 Pen Center USA Award. The Pastoral Clinic explores the relationship between intergenerational heroin use, poverty and colonial history in northern New Mexico. Ongoing work in the U.S. explores processes of legal re-entry and intimate repair that incarcerated and paroled drug users undertake, particularly within kin networks.

Our keynote speaker is Boona Cheema, former director of Building Opportunities for Self-Sufficiency and an advocate for social justice for more than 40 years. 

Our goal is to raise awareness and inspire the Berkeley population to engage both themselves and their community in productive conversation and action. This year's theme is Building Bridges. The symposium has historically stood for a platform and voice for our homeless clients and friends to advocate for themselves and changes that need to be made in the Berkeley community as a whole. We anticipate an audience of 100 or more students and community members hoping to engage in homelessness and poverty action. We want to hold our public socially responsible to the marginalization that continues to occur. Our hope is that this symposium will push people to alter the circumstances that allow for poverty to persist. Though our focus for the week is on inequity, we're all taking a look at intersectionality. What are the ways in which poverty intersects with gender issues, or disaster relief?

A panel of LGBTQ students will talk about their experiences of ""coming out"" and ""letting in"" (more on those two concepts below).

As a part of The Hook Up, a health-focused series of events cosponsored by Tang and GenEq, this panel allows students to learn from one another, because navigating the terrains of ""coming out"" and ""letting in"" can be confusing, exhausting, or sometimes just annoying. Come to get ideas, to share stories, to see yourself reflected in others, to support your communities, or for the free (healthy) snacks!

""Coming out"" is never a one-time process. We both meet new people, and sometimes we're prompted to circle back to the same people as our understandings of ourselves flows and shifts. In addition to a type of exporting our understandings of ourselves through a ""coming out"" process to others, ""letting in"" as a concept allows us to invite others into our understandings of self.
""A colleague suggests that we reframe 'coming out' as 'letting in,' as in letting others into our lives. He reasons that 'letting in' better manages fluidity and the people we (surprisingly) love. The 'letting in' frame allows for agency over what to disclose, to whom and when -- in gradations -- without assuming a fixed identity or that a private life conflicts with a public persona. If coming out is a confession, then letting in is a communion. We share our life stories, not just our secrets."" - Robert Espinoza

3/6: 
Poverty and Incarceration, by Human Rights of the Incarcerated, 6-8 PM

Our goal is to raise awareness and inspire the Berkeley population to engage both themselves and their community in productive conversation and action. This year's theme is Building Bridges. The symposium has historically stood for a platform and voice for our homeless clients and friends to advocate for themselves and changes that need to be made in the Berkeley community as a whole. We anticipate an audience of 100 or more students and community members hoping to engage in homelessness and poverty action. We want to hold our public socially responsible to the marginalization that continues to occur. Our hope is that this symposium will push people to alter the circumstances that allow for poverty to persist. Though our focus for the week is on inequity, we're all taking a look at intersectionality. What are the ways in which poverty intersects with gender issues, or disaster relief? These are the kinds of dialogues we bring up at our Poverty Symposium and hope that you'll join us for an engaging discussion about why poverty persists today and what we as citizens can do about it!

Panel 1) Opportunities and Challenges of Reunification: Politics after the Purge 
Moderator: Thomas Gold, UC Berkeley

What is the direction of North Koreas domestic politics after the purge, and what are the implications for its relations in Northeast Asia and with the United States? How do we create an accurate model for factional struggles, bureaucratic competition, and other issues under the framework of one‐man rule, and how can looking back at Chinese politics in the Mao era provide insights into the opportunities and challenges of reunification?
Panel 2) Inside Kim Jong Uns North Korea: Society and Economy 
Moderator: Orville Schell, Asia Society of New York
What are the significant recent changes in North Korean society, and what are the implications for opening and reform, stability, and improvement in human rights? What roles might non‐governmental organizations and media play in deepening outsiders understanding of the situation inside North Korea?
Panel 3) U.S. and its Allies: Roles for Reunification 
Moderator: John Delury, Yonsei University

How will the U.S. pivot to Asia influence relations among America and its allies, and their relations with China, in regards to North Korea, particularly on the nuclear issue? How do the U.S., South Korea, and others maintain policy coordination while at the same time taking proactive steps? What policy lessons can be learned from the experience of U.S.‐China relations and applied to the case of North Korea?

Our speakers will be presenting on topics relating to the status of Asian Americans and how it has been constructed around what is considered the norm in our society. John Tehranian will be presenting his paper, Selective Colorblindness: White Geographies in the Age of Obama, which examines the selective invocation of colorblindness in legal and political discourse and how the trope has served as a powerful vehicle for the creation, perpetuation and patrolling of white geographiesspaces characterized by an implicit hierarchy privileging white racial identity. Rose Cuison Villazors presentation will focus on both Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Specifically, she will discuss the extent immigration and citizenship laws constructed the legal status of U.S. national (both historically and today) with respect to American Samoans and how the legal construction of U.S. nationals relates to the social construction of Asian Americans as other.

Her book addresses the invisible war against fundamentalism within the Muslim community that is not getting media coverage. Madhavi Sunder will present her paper, A Triple Package or One Dimensional? Portrayals of Asian American Students and Parents. Stewart Changs presentation will address the construction of China in popular media as an unregulated or lawless space in respect to product quality control, labor practices, and human rights that casts China as a New Yellow Peril in the context of transnational product exportswhich in many ways mirrors the popular rhetoric of the 19th century exclusion movement that cast the Chinese as a threat to American labor. Dr. Hatem Bazian will be presenting his recent piece The Souls of Muslim Folk, which uses the Du Bois' idea of Double Consciousness as it relates to Muslims as a subject of contemporary discourse.

The dramatic uprising in Ukraine that culminated in the flight and impeachment of then President Viktor Yanukovich and the instauration of an interim Ukrainian government has brought a long simmering dispute between Russia on the one hand and the United States and its NATO and EU allies over Ukraines external orientation to a head. What was initially a dramatic domestic crisis has become the most dangerous geopolitical confrontation since the end of the Cold War. The panel, organized by the Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies, will address domestic politics and internal cleavages within Ukraine, Ukraines economic prospects, Russias interests and objectives, and the policy options for the US and its Western allies.

Biomarker tests for tuberculosis: Point-of-residence diagnostics

Globally, tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of adult death due to an infectious disease. The diagnosis of TB is complicated. Simply diagnosing the disease will not contribute to the control of this problem. TB control requires application of diagnostic tests at multiple levels. Most importantly, TB diagnostic tests need to be designed to facilitate transmission interruption. This is because by the time an individual with TB reaches a point-of-care (POC) facility, such a person would have infected at least 10 other close contacts. From these close contacts, new cases of TB will arise and such cases will infect 10 others before the diagnosis can be made. Thus, TB diagnostics must include the following performance characteristics: 1) predict who among those with latent TB infection (LTBI) will progress to active disease, 2) monitor response to treatment, once the treatment is initiated; 3) predict relapse TB; and 4) differentiate drug-resistant from drug-susceptible TB. We are analyzing host biomarkers that have these performance characteristics. In particular, we are examining host responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis phospholipid molecules predictive of these stages of TB infection. Once these biomarkers are identified, we plan to adapt an immunochromatographic platform to use the tests at the places where people live. In this way, we will be able to target high-risk populations with chemotherapy and greatly reduce the chances of new transmissions.

What am I,Colloquium,2014-04-12T00:00:00+00:00,2014-04-12T01:00:00+00:00,"Institute of East Asian Studies (2223 Fulton, 6th Floor), Conference Room",Hyon Gak Sunim,Center for Korean Studies (CKS),"In this world, which is torn by politics, religion, materialism, human beings believe too much that their thinking and ideas and beliefs are real. They attach to these ideas and beliefs, and they fight over them -- this only leads suffering. The word for that is ""ignorance"". Not only that, but through their intense desire, anger and ignorance, human beings are exterminating all life on this planet through a mindless pursuit of material comfort and temporary ease. If human beings do not soon ""wake up,"" they risk ending life for so many species of living things, not only themselves.

""Zen"" (meditation) means returning to the fundamental, true Self - which comes before nationality or religion. An American-born Zen monk and graduate of Yale and Harvard, Hyon Gak Sunim ordained as a monk in 1992. In his talk, he will stress that meditation is not based on religion, belief, or dogma. It is scientifically tested, peer-reviewed and affirmed technology for human beings to reach their innermost depths and most creative possibilities.
As we well know, recent scientific studies have proven that meditation frees up creative forces, unleashes unconscious creativities, and generates non-sectarian bases for genuine fellow-feeling and modes of compassionate interaction. The explosive field of neuroplasticity itself proves that when human beings spend even just a few minutes a day, following their breath and noticing deeply their thought-patterns, they are subtly freed from entrapping patterns of thought and feeling. This talk will introduce to the public the basic teaching of Zen, and its central technology of looking into one's true nature.

The iconic Texan is the creative genius behind historic recordings like ""Crazy,"" ""Hello Walls,"" ""Red Headed Stranger"" and ""Stardust."" His career has spanned six decades. His catalog boasts more than 200 albums. He's earned every conceivable award and honor to be bestowed a person in his profession. He has also amassed reputable credentials as an author, actor and activist.

In 2004, the Academy of Country Music bestowed him with the prestigious Gene Weed Special Achievement Award honoring Nelson's ""unprecedented and genre-defying contributions to popular music over his nearly 50-year career."" The March 2006 release of 'You Don't Know Me: The Songs of Cindy Walker,' a collection of 13 classics written by Country Music Hall of Fame songwriter Cindy Walker, earned Nelson a Grammy nomination for Best Country Album, augmenting a career that has been recognized with eight Grammy wins, a President's Merit Award, a Grammy Legend Award and the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award.

The Chemical Brothers, Basement Jaxx and Fatboy Slim would headline festivals from now until the end of days. The only way a new UK dance act could reach millions of people was to get a song on Masterchef. But in less than a year, Disclosure have turned all that on its head. The most successful British dance act in a generation, they've not only soared to the top of the charts and sold out venues across the world - they've also changed the nature of British pop, opening the door for underground dance acts to flood the mainstream. All this from a couple of brothers that only just finished school. The eldest, Guy, is 22. The youngest, Howard, is just 19.

Check this out. No: Czech this out. We lift the (iron) curtain on Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (Jaromil Jires, 1969), a cult classic that actually deserves its rep. This surreal cinema fable is half erotic tabloid, half gothic daydream, and all guilty pleasure. Valerie is a chaste thirteen-year-old whose awakening desire transforms her quaint village into an imp-infested realm of repressed sexuality. Everyone has their way and so too will our DJs wholl strip Valeries wonders of sonority and add their own promiscuous scores. The evening begins with a surrealist fashion show.

"After ""Assimilating Seoul"": Changgyŏng Garden and the Post-Colonial Remaking of Seouls Public Spaces",Colloquium,2014-05-03T00:00:00+00:00,2014-05-03T01:00:00+00:00,"Institute of East Asian Studies (2223 Fulton, 6th Floor), Conference Room","Todd A. Henry,
							Assistant Professor of History,

							UC San Diego",Center for Korean Studies (CKS),"The title of this talk is meant to signal two related topics for discussion. The first refers to my new book, ""Assimilating Seoul: Japanese Rule and The Politics of Public Space in Colonial Korea, 1910-1945"" (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2014). The introductory part of the talk reviews the central argument of that book  namely, that public space functioned as contact zones wherein varying projects of assimilation were both implanted by state officials and contested by their non-elite users. The second part of the talk extends this story beyond the liberation of 1945 and into the history of South Korea. In this context, the title refers to the project of recasting the capital city as a capitalist and anti-communist focus of post-colonial politics. After briefly examining the post-liberation strategy of erasure, the fate of Namsans Shintō Shrines, I turn to the more common strategy of decolonization, which involved creatively recycling the citys palace grounds before ultimately restoring them. To trace this decolonizing strategy, I explore the fate of Changgyŏng Garden, whose popular zoo, park, museum and other recreational facilities persisted long after 1945. Meanwhile, the early architects of South Korea creatively re-used this site for new national purposes, including to memorialize anti-communist patriots and to showcase the countrys infant industries. It was only over the next three decades that the overlapping functions of this public space were separated into distinct sites, each capable of carrying out a specific role in re-subjectifying the citizenry.

Early music specialist and celebrated viola da gamba player Jordi Savall returns to Cal Performances with one of his characteristically fascinating and historically informed programs. For Folias Antiquas & Criollas, Savall leads an all-star gathering of musicians, including his renowned Hespèrion XXI ensemble and Mexico's Tembembe Ensamble Continuo. The works on the program traverse art and folk music of Spain, Mexico, and Peru from the late Renaissance and Baroque, as well as contemporary styles such as jarocho and huasteca. The guitar-heavy music is fiery and rhythmically exciting, and requires great improvisational prowess from the musicians.

Cultural ambassadors of South Africa for more than 50 years, and three-time Grammy winners, Ladysmith sings a distinctive brand of a cappella that marries breathtaking South African harmonies with the sounds and sentiments of Christian gospel music. The result is uplifting and joyous, ethereal and earthy at once.

A panel of LGBTQ students will talk about their experiences of ""coming out"" and ""letting in"" (more on those two concepts below).

As a part of The Hook Up, a health-focused series of events cosponsored by Tang and GenEq, this panel allows students to learn from one another, because navigating the terrains of ""coming out"" and ""letting in"" can be confusing, exhausting, or sometimes just annoying. Come to get ideas, to share stories, to see yourself reflected in others, to support your communities, or for the free (healthy) snacks!

""Coming out"" is never a one-time process. We both meet new people, and sometimes we're prompted to circle back to the same people as our understandings of ourselves flows and shifts. In addition to a type of exporting our understandings of ourselves through a ""coming out"" process to others, ""letting in"" as a concept allows us to invite others into our understandings of self.
""A colleague suggests that we reframe 'coming out' as 'letting in,' as in letting others into our lives. He reasons that 'letting in' better manages fluidity and the people we (surprisingly) love. The 'letting in' frame allows for agency over what to disclose, to whom and when -- in gradations -- without assuming a fixed identity or that a private life conflicts with a public persona. If coming out is a confession, then letting in is a communion. We share our life stories, not just our secrets."" - Robert Espinoza

You will have the unforgettable chance to experience the incredible sound of this remarkable ensemble, directed by three of the classical music world's podium greats.
One orchestra, three master conductors. No other musical ensemble is more closely associated with the history and tradition of European classical music than the Vienna Philharmonic. Over a formidable 170-year history, the musicians of this orchestra have maintained a tradition of beauty and excellence in music-makingenjoying close associations with many of the most influential composersWagner, Verdi, Bruckner, Brahms, Liszt, Strauss, Mahlerand conductorsRichter, Furtwängler, von Karajan, Bernsteinin the history of music. The Vienna Philharmonic visits Berkeley for a three-concert residency with repertoire shining a light on the orchestra's deep connection to its famous musical legacy.
 Highlights include Italian conductor Lorin Maazel, a renowned Mahler interpreter, in a program including Mahler's 4th Symphony; Brahms's Third Symphony (premiered by the Vienna Philharmonic in 1883) conducted by stellar Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons""the next big thing among young conductors"" (New York Times); and an exploration of enduring scores by influential Viennese composers (and a contemporary work from a composer who is creating in Vienna today), conducted by Franz Welser-Mösta rare chance to experience his magnificent music-making beyond Cleveland where he is music director of The Cleveland Orchestra.
 The Vienna Philharmonic's residency will also include extensive activities in the community and with UC Berkeley students, including master classes, chamber music, and a special symposium focusing on the history of the orchestra.

Music Studies Colloquium - Gjerdingen: The Institutionalization of Apprenticeship in the Great Conservatories: A Cognitive Interpretation of a Non-Verbal Praxis,Performing Arts - Music: Colloquium/Symposium/Conference: DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC,2014-03-18T00:30:00+00:00,2014-03-18T02:00:00+00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Robert Gjerdingen,

							Northwestern University",Department of Music,"Music, like all the other crafts of pre-industrial Europe, was learned through apprenticeship. When formalized, an apprenticeship often involved a ten-year indenture of a young boy or girl to a master or mistress. Unpaid labor was exchanged for entry into the mystery of the craft. The four conservatori or foundling homes of Naples were the first to institutionalize this indenture, ultimately aggregating as many as 600 boys for the intense study of music. Just as the four Inns of Court in London raised clerkship to a higher level in English law, so the conservatories of Naples created a critical mass of young talents such as Europe had never seen. By the end of the nineteenth century almost every industrializing nation had established its own version of a music conservatory.
Perhaps the low social status of foundlings and performing musicians and their hermetic insiders praxis (a hold-over from the closed world of craft guilds) led educated writers on music to overlook or to deprecate the mindless repetitive exercises of the conservatories. Even when, at the Paris Conservatory, the work of replicating master patterns was raised to a level of finesse comparable to that of the École des Beaux-Arts, it was still not considered of any theoretical significance.
 Only from the mid-1990s did a small group of scholars begin to re-examine and rediscover what was being learned in the great conservatories. In modern terms, we can now recognize a systematic praxis aimed at the building up of a huge repertory of schemata or constructions, which collectively operated like what contemporary linguists term a usage-based grammar. The goal of such an undertaking would be to produce native speakers of a language, and the many great composers who emerged from this training would seem to support its efficacy.

With more than 90 works to his credit, McIntyre's choreography has been praised for its ""singular connection between movement and spirit"" (Los Angeles Times), an athletic style that is both winningly clever and earnestly soulful. McIntyre's works reflect on timeless human themes like loss, wonder, and innocence, and he has been inspired by topics as far-ranging as Shakespearean tragedy, the 1970s children's record Free to Be...You and Me, and post-Katrina New Orleans. The company returns after its warmly received Cal Performances debut two seasons ago, with McIntyre's (serious), a gripping work that explores emotional alienation and social tension.

Kronos Quartet with Combat Paper Project: A Meditation on the Great War: World Premiere!,Performing Arts - Music: Non-Music Department,2014-04-07T03:00:00+00:00,2014-04-07T04:00:00+00:00,Hertz Concert Hall,,Cal Performances,"Known for its extraordinary breadth of musicianship and restless creative spirit, Kronos Quartet can always be counted on to set its dynamic ensemble playing against the backdrop of human experience. A Meditation on the Great War, a collaboration with Iraq war veteran-turned-visual artist Drew Cameron of the Combat Paper Project, commemorates the centennial of the outbreak of World War I with a new multimedia work exploring history and its haunting of the present: a newly commissioned score by composer Aleksandra Vrebalov inspired by anti-war narratives of that era, and new film by Bill Morrison that draws from archival WWI footage. Kronos, now celebrating its 40th anniversary, is an incubator of ideas, always ready to ask us to reflect on our role in world events, and the history we are all creating.

Music Studies Colloquium - Wong: Rereading Ethnomusicology for Gender and Erotics,Performing Arts - Music: Colloquium/Symposium/Conference: DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC,2014-04-08T00:30:00+00:00,2014-04-08T02:00:00+00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Deborah Wong,

							UC Riverside",Department of Music,"How and why did gender studies move so quickly through ethnomusicology, and then (mostly) disappear? Why has sexuality studies barely made any appearance at all, despite musics central role in shaping desire? Ethnomusicology moved to a post-gender stance with lightning speed. That is, after key publications about women/gender and music in the 1980s-90s, ethnomusicologists began to add the phrase and gender to their arguments but to a great extent stopped focusing on it. As Ellen Koskoff has written, after a brief spurt in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, work in feminist and genderist ethnomusicology seemed to slow in relation to that of musicology(Koskoff 2005, 90). 
I offer a reclamation model meant to dialogically regroup, recoup, and reformulate existing ethnomusicological scholarship. Attention to gendered orders of music is missing from much of our most treasured literature, and I aim to reread itto read it anew, to read it with new eyesnot in order to rescue it but to fold the gesture of critique into our work as I make visible the invisibility of gender in so much of our best scholarship. This is in some ways homage and in others an openly counterfactual history. I will reread my own book on Thai music by folding in current media coverage of spectacularly misogynistic demonstrations against the female Prime Minister. I will reread several key monographs by other ethnomusicologists to consider the range of acts available to usradical rereading, evocative/poetic rereading, mournful rereadingwhile arguing that this agentive feminist act of reading (refusing the apparent absence) is an extension of the gaze exerted by subalterns of many kinds in many places. I aim to activate a bifocal consciousness and to exert the black look articulated by bell hooks to theorize a reading method for ethnomusicologists that traces the ghostly presence of gender and erotics, reading around their apparent absence for their outlines and sonic traces. I will draw from the abundance of theories addressing the act of oppositional watching/listening and theories for rereading from philosophy and education, which emphasize how re-knowing and re-cognition is part of the rereading process. Can a second reading open up a third space?
Neither a rescue operation nor an apologist celebration, this is instead a deeply necessary and respectful effort to reengage with (rather than disengage from) leading scholarship by ethnomusicologists that has mostly turned a blind eye toward gender and sexuality. I offer both a practical method and a theory of rereading drawn from feminist theory, minoritarian studies, and translation studies.

Politics Beyond the Human / How We Forgot the Sea,Workshop,2014-04-11T01:00:00+00:00,2014-04-11T03:00:00+00:00,340 Moffitt Undergraduate Library,,The Program in Critical Theory,"Speaker/Performer: Ashley Dawson,

New York City has nearly six hundred miles of coastline. We turn our backs on the waters that surround us to our great peril. For many years, experts of various stripes have been warning about the threat posed to the city by climate change-induced rising tides. In 1999, for example, the Environmental Defense Fund published a report titled Hot Nights in the City: Global Warming, Sea-Level Rise, and the New York Metropolitan Region. A decade later, MoMA and P.S.1 collaborated on a design competition, Rising Tides: Projects for New Yorks Waterfront, that was intended to explore innovative solutions to the citys heightened vulnerability to storm-surge induced inundation. Yet when Hurricane Sandy struck New York just over a year ago, the city seemed almost totally unprepared for the infrastructural and human emergencies provoked by this natural disaster. Numerous factors combined to make New York vulnerable to Sandy, but underlying them all was the fact that weve largely forgotten our citys links to its maritime environment. Since the spread of mass air transport, few of us travel long distances on the surface of the planets oceans. Even fewer of us actually depend directly on the sea for our livelihoods. In the words of the filmmaker Alan Sekula, the oceans have become the worlds forgotten space, an occult zone absolutely crucial to global economic exchange and yet almost totally elided from cultural representation. This is the story of how we forgot the sea.

Check this out. No: Czech this out. We lift the (iron) curtain on Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (Jaromil Jires, 1969), a cult classic that actually deserves its rep. This surreal cinema fable is half erotic tabloid, half gothic daydream, and all guilty pleasure. Valerie is a chaste thirteen-year-old whose awakening desire transforms her quaint village into an imp-infested realm of repressed sexuality. Everyone has their way and so too will our DJs wholl strip Valeries wonders of sonority and add their own promiscuous scores. The evening begins with a surrealist fashion show.

Cloudcuckooland: Adornos Musical Utopianism,Lecture: Non-Music Department,2014-04-22T01:00:00+00:00,2014-04-22T03:00:00+00:00,3335 Dwinelle Hall,,The Program in Critical Theory,"Speaker/Performer: Fred Rush,

 Associate Professor of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame
Adorno has a complex attitude toward utopian thought. On the one hand, he views as dangerous and destructive fascist and vulgar Marxist strands of utopianism and has a subtle diagnostic critique of their attractions and deficiencies. On the other hand, he views the proper use of utopian imagination to be essential for human freedom and writes copiously about the dangers of prior ideological constraint not only of the content of imagination but also of the possible forms that imagination can take, political and otherwise. This paper joins an analysis of Adornos thought on utopianism with an exposition and critique of his interpretation of Mahlers symphonic practice. I argue that Adornos discussion of Mahler both takes precedence in his thought on artistic utopianism and clarifies his treatment of the continuing salience of utopian thought in politics. (Rush)

The Something
The Something is a conglomeration of possibilities for exploration and observation. Participants might begin by tentatively plunking a string, picking up a fabric or holding a video camera. Eventually, the sounds gather, the visuals evolve, and the dynamics of our actions coalesce into moments of ordered harmony, dissolve back into chaos, and then re-emerge ordered once again. The spectator simultaneously becomes actor and observer. The project seeks to stimulate intersubjective creative production and emancipated collaboration.

In preparing the musicians for this performance, Payne will teach the principles, structures, and techniques of humpback whale song though several group sound experiments, including, but not limited to, deep listening exercises with audio recordings (garnered from her groundbreaking collection of field recordings with ex-husband Roger Payne, Songs of the Humpback Whale) and analyzing spectrograms of whalesong through a musical, rather than research-oriented, lens. Along with these musical building blocks, she will also expand on the various functions that whale song serves in whale culture. Gesundheit will aid in translating Paynes concepts and instructions into performance strategies.
The kora is the central instrument in the Griot tradition of using song to transmit news and stories, and to mark ceremonial occasions.

 UC Berkeley, Mechanical Engineering
The musculoskeletal system is comprised of large load bearing soft tissues that absorb and distribute the complex loads placed on the joint. The intervertebral disc is comprised of mechanically and structurally unique substructures including the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus, which function together to support and absorb spinal loads.
Disc degeneration occurs as early as the second decade of life and contributes to over $130 billion in medical costs. Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes.
Noninvasive techniques to measure internal mechanical properties will be discussed. Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion. One approach to biological repair strategies that will be discussed is to cultivate engineered tissue in vitro, permitting some elaboration of extracellular matrix for improved long-term outcome following in vivo implantation.

The crystallographic parameters of atomic and ionic solids are fixed by the size and coordination number of their elemental building blocks, thus restricting the types of structures that can be formed. We have demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) as artificial atoms in nanoparticle superlattice assemblies. These three-dimensional conjugates consist of densely functionalized, highly oriented nucleic acids covalently attached to the surface of inorganic nanoparticles. The strength and length of the programmable DNA bonds between these structures can be adjusted by varying DNA sequence and length, and the properties of the atoms can be adjusted by varying nanoparticle size, shape, and composition. We have developed design rules for this assembly process, analogous to Paulings Rules for ionic solids but ultimately more powerful. These rules can be used as a guide for the rational construction of functional nanoparticle-based materials for plasmonic, photonic, and catalytic applications.

Cancer therapy has a critical unmet need, which is to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients.
There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system.
A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy.
We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. The assay complements current genetic characterizations of tumor variation between individuals and should greatly speed up the testing of new drugs in research settings.
I will demonstrate how bringing these microfluidic devices into the clinic will greatly enabled by the use of stereolithography, a form of 3D printing.

Recent Progress with Nanowires: Growth and Energy Applications: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-04-25T22:00:00+00:00,2014-04-25T23:00:00+00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,"Prof. Lars Samuelson, Nano Structure Consortium Founder,

							Lund University, Sweden",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The scientific field of (compound) semiconductor nanowires got started seriously in the US and in Europe about 15 years ago, some ten years after the original break-through research conducted by Dr. Kenji Hiruma and his team at Hitachi in Japan.

Our own early work was initially very much exploratory research, testing to what extent we could understand, control and have fun with the ways in which nanowires nucleate and grow. The whole field of nanowires saw great progress in the use of nanowires for physics and for fairly simple model devices. Just in the last five, or so, years we have seen serious break-through in novel growth methods and the understanding of nanowire growth, as well as in the development of new technologies enabling efficient fabrication of nanowires for areas like solar cells and light-emitting diodes.
In this talk I will cover all these areas, with an emphasis on recent progress in controlled and efficient fabrication of nanowires for energy applications.

Precision survey technique is basic method in archaeological research and use of a total station is an important prerequisite for use of the Maptek Laser Scanner in the April 11 workshop. This workshop will train users in the process of mapping in locations with centimeter level precision to serve as laser scanning control points or for archaeological site mapping. The workshop will begin with a 45 minute lecture on the principals of survey at 9:10am at the Archaeological Research Facility (room 101) and then we will break up into four groups each with a total station where we will cover the following steps
- survey strategy and the placement of control points
- establishing a survey position
- leveling the tripod
- placement and fine leveling of the instrument
- setting the horizontal angle (backsight)
- basic use of Sokkia interface for shooting other points with a stadia rod and prism

Dr A. P. Matthaiou (Greek Epigraphic Society & American School of Classical Studies at Athens) will be presenting for the first time in the US an unpublished manumission document from Phigaleia (Peloponnese). In their vast majority, manumission records, a valuable source of information on ancient slavery, date to the Hellenistic and Roman Imperial periods. The new bronze tablet from Phigaleia is one of the earliest ever documents of this category dating to the early Classical period (early 5th cent. BCE). It also attests for the first time to local cult of Athena as a goddess of the underworld.

In this talk, I propose a psychological constructivist perspective that can be used to understand the emotional lives of both humans and nonhuman animals. I begin by outlining a framework that maps the ingredients of emotion across phylogeny. Next, I present evidence of the existence of those ingredients in nonhuman primates (rhesus macaques). Specifically, I discuss how autonomic nervous system activity and behavioral reactivity data in rhesus macaques can give evidence of the psychological potency and affective value of dynamic visual stimuli. Researchers using such data can capitalize on the strengths of nonhuman primate models to identify the neurobiology that subserves the ingredients of emotion. For instance, I demonstrate early life damage to the amygdala permanently impairs affective responding in rhesus macaques. The implications for the evolution of emotion and translational social psychology will be discussed.

A panel of LGBTQ students will talk about their experiences of ""coming out"" and ""letting in"" (more on those two concepts below).

As a part of The Hook Up, a health-focused series of events cosponsored by Tang and GenEq, this panel allows students to learn from one another, because navigating the terrains of ""coming out"" and ""letting in"" can be confusing, exhausting, or sometimes just annoying. Come to get ideas, to share stories, to see yourself reflected in others, to support your communities, or for the free (healthy) snacks!

""Coming out"" is never a one-time process. We both meet new people, and sometimes we're prompted to circle back to the same people as our understandings of ourselves flows and shifts. In addition to a type of exporting our understandings of ourselves through a ""coming out"" process to others, ""letting in"" as a concept allows us to invite others into our understandings of self.
""A colleague suggests that we reframe 'coming out' as 'letting in,' as in letting others into our lives. He reasons that 'letting in' better manages fluidity and the people we (surprisingly) love. The 'letting in' frame allows for agency over what to disclose, to whom and when -- in gradations -- without assuming a fixed identity or that a private life conflicts with a public persona. If coming out is a confession, then letting in is a communion. We share our life stories, not just our secrets."" - Robert Espinoza

Using research on religion and prosocial behavior as an example, I will review and evaluate what both genetic and cultural evolutionary perspectives offer our understanding of religions forms, functions and origins.

How does the human brain use neural activity to create and represent meanings of words, sentences and stories? One way to study this question is to give peopletext to read, while scanning their brain. We have been doing such experiments with fMRI (1 mm spatial resolution) and MEG (1 msec time resolution) brain imaging. As a result, we have learned answers to questions such as ""Are the neural encodings of word meaning the same in your brain and mine?"", ""Are neural encodings of word meaning built out of recognizable subcomponents, or are they randomly different for each word?,"" and ""What sequence of neurally encoded information flows through the brain during the half-second in which the brain comprehends a word?"" This talk will summarize some of what we have learned, and newer questions we are currently working on.

							Asian Studies, University of British Columbia",Center for Chinese Studies (CCS),"Many early Chinese thinkers had as their spiritual ideal the state of wu-wei, or effortless action. By advocating spontaneity as an explicit moral and religious goal, they inevitably involved themselves in the paradox of wu-weithe problem of how one can try not to trywhich later became one of the central tensions in East Asian religious thought. In this talk, I will look at the paradox from both an early Chinese and a contemporary perspective, drawing upon work in social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and evolutionary theory to argue that this paradox is a real one, and is moreover intimately tied up with problems surrounding cooperation in large-scale societies and concerns about moral hypocrisy.

Music Studies Colloquium - Gjerdingen: The Institutionalization of Apprenticeship in the Great Conservatories: A Cognitive Interpretation of a Non-Verbal Praxis,Performing Arts - Music,2014-03-18T00:30:00+00:00,2014-03-18T02:00:00+00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Robert Gjerdingen,

							Northwestern University",Department of Music,"Music, like all the other crafts of pre-industrial Europe, was learned through apprenticeship. When formalized, an apprenticeship often involved a ten-year indenture of a young boy or girl to a master or mistress. Unpaid labor was exchanged for entry into the mystery of the craft. The four conservatori or foundling homes of Naples were the first to institutionalize this indenture, ultimately aggregating as many as 600 boys for the intense study of music. Just as the four Inns of Court in London raised clerkship to a higher level in English law, so the conservatories of Naples created a critical mass of young talents such as Europe had never seen. By the end of the nineteenth century almost every industrializing nation had established its own version of a music conservatory.
Perhaps the low social status of foundlings and performing musicians and their hermetic insiders praxis (a hold-over from the closed world of craft guilds) led educated writers on music to overlook or to deprecate the mindless repetitive exercises of the conservatories. Even when, at the Paris Conservatory, the work of replicating master patterns was raised to a level of finesse comparable to that of the École des Beaux-Arts, it was still not considered of any theoretical significance.
 Only from the mid-1990s did a small group of scholars begin to re-examine and rediscover what was being learned in the great conservatories. In modern terms, we can now recognize a systematic praxis aimed at the building up of a huge repertory of schemata or constructions, which collectively operated like what contemporary linguists term a usage-based grammar. The goal of such an undertaking would be to produce native speakers of a language, and the many great composers who emerged from this training would seem to support its efficacy.

Are There Sensitive Periods for the Effects of Early Experience on Cognitive and Social Competence? Lessons from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project,Lecture,2014-03-31T20:00:00+00:00,2014-03-31T21:30:00+00:00,3105 Tolman Hall,,Institute of Human Development,"Speaker/Performer: Nathan Fox,

 Child Development Lab, Department of Human Development at University of Maryland
Developmental psychologists and educators assume that early experiences shape the brain and neural circuitry for emerging cognitive and social behaviors over the first years of life. Most of the evidence for these assumptions is based on rodent and non human primate animal research. Far less has been published on the effects of early experience that is not correlational in nature. The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP) is the first randomized trial of a family intervention for children who experienced significant psychosocial neglect early in their lives. A group of infants living in institutions in Romania were recruited and randomized to be taken out of the institution and placed into family/foster care homes or to remain in the institution. Follow up of these children occurred at 42 and 54 months of age and at 8 years of age. Multiple domains, including cognitive, socio-emotional, psychiatric, and brain imaging were assessed at each age. Three questions are posed in this study and this talk: first, are there lasting effects of early psychosocial deprivation as children develop over the school years. Second, is intervention successful in ameliorating deficits as a result of institutionalization. And third, are there sensitive periods in delivering the intervention that explain both success and failure to improve cognitive and socio-emotional behavior.

A Tale of Two Hormones: Implications for Status and Financial Decision-Making,Colloquium,2014-04-02T20:00:00+00:00,2014-04-02T21:15:00+00:00,5101 Tolman Hall,"Pranjal Mehta,
							Assistant Professor,

							University of Oregon",Institute of Personality and Social Research,"Lay beliefs and traditional theories propose that testosterone should promote higher status, but empirical evidence is inconsistent. According to the dual-hormone hypothesis (Mehta & Josephs, 2010), testosterone should interact with the stress hormone cortisol to influence status-relevant social behaviors. In this talk I will provide empirical support for the dual-hormone hypothesis, elucidate the underlying mechanisms, and identify social contextual ""triggers"". Across multiple studies, higher testosterone was positively related to status-relevant outcomes -- such as leadership perceptions in group interactions and financial earnings in stock traders -- only when cortisol levels were low. When cortisol was high, higher testosterone was associated with lower status. Additional evidence points to two possible mechanisms. First, high testosterone + low cortisol leads to dominant behaviors in social interactions, behaviors that are known to promote higher status. Second, high testosterone + high cortisol leads to negative emotional reactivity to social stressors, an affective profile that is negatively correlated with status. I argue that variability in stress axis activity tips testosterone toward behaviors that either encourage or undermine status. Finally, I discuss recent results suggesting that these dual-hormone profiles can be induced through psychosocial interventions.

The Scientist in the Crib: How Babies and Young Children Think (BEUHS342),Workshop,2014-04-02T20:10:00+00:00,2014-04-02T21:30:00+00:00,"Tang Center, University Health Services, Section Club",,Work/Life,"Speaker/Performer: Alison Gopnik, Professor of Psychology, UC Berkeley
In the last thirty years there has been a revolution in our scientific understanding of babies and young children that has also transformed our understanding of human nature itself. In this talk, Professor Gopnik will outline some of the new discoveries and their implications for the way we think about young children and ourselves.
Human beings have a longer childhood than any other animal  our children are more helpless and dependent than any others. Why make babies so helpless for so long? Professor Gopnik will talk about how childhood is responsible for our uniquely human consciousness and our ability to learn, imagine and love and how this long protected childhood gives human babies an opportunity to learn, play and plan and work as adults.
In their unstoppable pretend play, preschoolers use their discoveries to imagine new ways that the world might be. Children not only learn about the world around them, they also learn about other people and themselves. By the time they are three or four they understand love and morality. These remarkable learning abilities reflect special features of babies brains - features that may actually make babies more conscious than adults.
Alison Gopnik is a professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley. She received her BA from McGill University and her PhD from Oxford University. She is an internationally recognized leader in the study of childrens learning and development and was the first to argue that childrens minds could help us understand deep philosophical questions. She is the author of over 100 journal articles and several books . She has also written widely about cognitive science and psychology for Science, The Times Literary Supplement, the New York Times, New Scientist and Slate, among others. Professor Gopnik has frequently appeared on TV and radio including, The Charlie Rose Show and The Colbert Report.

"The Science of a Meaningful Life: Self-Care for Health Professionals: A day-long seminar for health care professionals featuring Shauna Shapiro, Ph.D., and and Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D.",Seminar,2014-04-04T16:30:00+00:00,2014-04-05T00:30:00+00:00,"International House, Chevron Auditorium",,,"Speaker/Performer: Shauna Shapiro, Ph.D., and Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D.,

 Greater Good Science Center
Sponsors: International House, Greater Good Science Center
This day-long seminar will offer valuable psychological tools to health professionals and others confronting stress, apathy, and burnout in their work. It will feature two of the worlds leading experts on the social and emotional dimensions to the helping professions, Shauna Shapiro, Ph.D., and Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D. Both Dr. Shapiro and Dr. Remen will provide insight into the challenges facing health professionals today and offer a compassionate, practical approach to addressing these challenges.

Dr. Shapiro will lead the program. Based on her recent book, The Art and Science of Mindfulness: Integrating Mindfulness into Psychotherapy and the Helping Professions, she will offer scientific research and meditative practices for therapists interested in awakening the mind and opening the heart. Drawing on current research in psychology, medicine, and cognitive neuroscience, Dr. Shapiro will investigate the effects of mindfulness meditation on decreasing pathology and increasing positive psychological and physiological states.

She will also explore the importance of self-care for health care professionals. Through lecture, meditation practices, clinical case examples, and small group activities, she will explore specific pathways of applying mindfulness personally and professionally to cultivate greater health, well-being, and freedom.
Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D. Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D.
In her special guest presentation, Dr. Remen will offer additional tools of self-care to help prevent burnout and foster well-being. She will discuss how health professionals training often convinces them that approaching work with a tender heart is unprofessional, yet this belief can make them vulnerable to depression, cynicism, loneliness, and a loss of meaning. Revitalizing their work, she will explain, requires bringing their heart into the center of it, making health professionals more open to moments of awareness and connection. In the process, they may find meaning in routine tasks and discover not only greater joy in daily work but even a sense of gratitude for that work. Her talk will provide innovative ways to make a healing difference for patients, clients, students, and yourself.

Attendees will be able to:

 Identify the challenges health professionals face to sustaining meaning and avoiding burnout in their work
 Define mindfulness and describe Dr. Shapiros IAA model of mindfulness (Intention, Attention, and Attitude)
 Identify the effects mindfulness has on decreasing pathology and increasing positive psychological and physiological states
 Apply the science of mindfulness and self-compassion to their work
 Explain how investing more of themselves in their work can restore a sense of meaning, purpose, and service

The Trouble with Race Talk: How The Fear of Racial Conversations Causes Racial Inequality,Colloquium,2014-04-09T20:00:00+00:00,2014-04-09T21:15:00+00:00,5101 Tolman Hall,"Phil Goff,
							Assistant Professor,

							University of California, Los Angeles",Institute of Personality and Social Research,"The latter part of the 20th century saw an impressive decline in the overt expression of racial animosity towards non-Whites. This decline, however, was largely unaccompanied by a reduction in racial inequality. The seeming disconnect between racial attitudes and racial outcomes has troubled contemporary social scientists who had long assumed that individual-level racism accounted for racial disparities. Popular explanations for this disconnect often suggest that individual-level racism has merely ""gone underground,"" having become less popular to voice, but just as prevalent--and just as responsible for racial inequality.

My research investigates the possibility that contextual explanations play an under-explored role in producing racial inequality. Rather than focusing on racial attitudes that are internal to an individual, my research examines ways in which environmental factors can produce racially disparate outcomes. Through this research I hope to expand the scope of what comes to mind when one thinks of the causes and consequences of inequality.

							Professor of Psychology,

							University of Texas at San Antonio",Institute of Personality and Social Research,"Carlos Castaneda supposedly said No one is important enough to make me angry. However, that sentiment applies to a small fraction of humanity. This talk begins with a conceptualization of anger and related constructs in the context of everyday life, and then proceeds to a rationale for the treatment of dysfunctional anger. Here, the DSM-5 is a necessary point of reference though its shortcomings are worth acknowledging. In the regulation of anger, the cognitive behavioral approach with its roots in appraisal theory and learning theory remains dominant. However, it will be shown that new developments in theory and research encourage a more integrative approach to anger regulation. Preliminary treatment outcome data shed light on the challenges posed by this new approach. Inasmuch as treatment is informed by assessment, recent developments in the latter (especially the differentiation of a variety of anger parameters and expression styles) receive special mention. In conclusion, anger and related phenomena provide a testbed for theories of emotion that in turn can be applied towards the promotion of emotional health.

Galaxy clusters are unique astrophysical laboratories that contain many thermal and non-thermal phenomena that demand a coordinated effort from theory, numerical simulations, and observations. After discussing a few of the major open questions in galaxy cluster formation and evolution, I'll present our recent work in attempting to model the non-thermal cosmic-ray population present in clusters. It is proposed that cosmic shocks that propagate through the intracluster medium form through the process of structure formation, and may be capable of accelerating charged particles through diffusive shock acceleration. These relativistic particles decay and radiate through a variety of mechanisms, and have observational signatures in radio, hard X-ray, and Gamma-ray wavelengths. Modelling these dynamics require a combination of cosmological hydrodynamics coupled with a model to follow the momentum-space distribution of cosmic ray electrons and protons. We have implemented such a model by combining Enzo, an Adaptive Mesh Refinement hydrodynamics + N-body particle-mesh gravity solver, with a numerical library for cosmic ray transport. I will end with a look to what future observatories in the radio, X-ray, and sub-mm may uncover and what new capabilities our simulations must have to understand fundamental physical processes present in galaxy clusters.

Astronomers encounter a series of ethical dilemmas during their careers that need to be managed correctly if the integrity of the field is to be improved or at least preserved. I will argue that one can approach these dilemmas by considering that they usually span the three ethical dimensions of education, research, and enterprise. I will present a few topics in detail, such as authorship and intellectual property, and also show how ethics can be included in a science curriculum.

Galaxy formation is a complex, hierarchical, highly non-linear process, which involves gravitational collapse of dark matter and baryons, supersonic, highly compressible and turbulent flows of gas, cooling and heating of gas, star formation, and stellar feedback. Nevertheless, despite the apparent complexity of these processes, galaxies exhibit a number of striking regularities, such as tight correlations between galaxy sizes and stellar masses and the mass and extent of their parent halos dominated by dark matter. I will discuss our current understanding of halo structure and physical motivation for the definition of halo radius and mass. I will also summarize the relations between stellar mass and halo mass and galaxy sizes and halo virial radius. I will show that the latter relation is close to linear, which indicates that sizes of galaxies of all types are set by specific angular momentum induced by gravitational torques during galaxy formation. In addition, I will show that stellar surface density profiles of galaxies of different morphological types at radii beyond half-mass radius have similar shape. The stellar mass-halo mass relation is tight, but its shape is complex and is determined by the complicated physics of star formation and feedback. I will show that the current generation of galaxy formation simulations is capable of reproducing the shape of this relation with reasonable set of assumptions about feedback physics.

There has been tremendous progress in the past few years on the measurements of masses of
neutron stars and black holes in our Galaxy. In this talk, I will discuss how applying statistical
techniques on the new data reveals the evolution of these compact objects and the dividing
line between them, while raising questions about our understanding of the supernova mechanism.
I will then present our recent measurements of the radii of neutron stars and a new formalism by
which these measurements can be used to study the neutron star interior. I will show how the
combination of the tightly constrained radii and the discovery of a two solar mass pulsar has allowed
for the first astrophysical inference of the pressure of cold matter above nuclear saturation density.
Finally, I will discuss the implications of these developments for nuclear theory and astrophysics.

The 21 m HI line emission has been useful in probing the major part of the interstellar gas over more than a half century. A difficulty has been due to the uncertainty in the HI physical conditions, i.e., the spin temperature Ts and line optical depth which cannot be directly derived from single observed parameter, the HI brightness. It is discussed that there is dark gas which is not detectable either in the HI or CO emission in the Galaxy, and that H2 without CO may offer a possible explanation for the dark gas whose density may lie around several 100 cm-3. 
 The dust properties derived by the Planck satellite offer a new accurate measure of the interstellar dust column density, and accordingly the gas column density. The new method, which I will present, allows us to estimate both Ts and HI column density. In this talk, I will present a comparison among CO, HI and Planck dust properties toward high-latitude CO clouds (MBM53-55), and show that the HI envelope around the CO clouds is very massive, in the order of 20,000Mo, as compared with the CO cloud whose mass is 2,000 Mo. Ts of the HI envelope is low in a range 20-80 K, where 70 % of the HI has Ts lower than 50 K and density higher than 100 cm-3. I will show that a similar trend is observed for the whole sky, and suggest that the cold and dense HI gas is common in the interstellar medium. I finally discuss such cold HI as the dark gas candidate.

In the past decade, our understanding of the galaxy population in the last 12 billion years of cosmic history (i.e., since z=4) has improved significantly, thanks to the increasing ability to construct representative snapshots (in time) from z=4 (when the universe was ~1.5 billion years old) to the local universe. I will summarize our current knowledge of the evolution of massive galaxies since z=4, with an emphasis on the recent results from the UltraVISTA survey. I will conclude by presenting new findings on the evolution since z=3 of the progenitors of local ultra-massive galaxies, challenging previously proposed pictures for the formation and evolution of massive elliptical galaxies.

The Auroral Phenomenon: Tracing Magnetic Fields from Brown Dwarfs to Exoplanets,Colloquium: Astronomy Colloquia,2014-03-21T00:10:00+00:00,2014-03-21T01:10:00+00:00,1 LeConte Hall,,Department of Astronomy,"Speaker/Performer: Greg Hallinan,

At the lower end of the main sequence, near the boundary between stars and brown dwarfs, a major transition is observed in magnetic activity. The high temperature, X-ray emitting coronae surrounding solar-type stars fade rapidly and have virtually disappeared for the coolest spectral classes, L, T and Y. Magnetic field topologies undergo a dramatic transformation to large-scale, stable configurations and rotation rates increase by an order of magnitude, indicating stellar wind assisted magnetic braking is severely reduced or absent. I will present results that show that this transition also signals the arrival of a new group of electromagnetic phenomena, completely distinct from those traditionally associated with stellar activity. In fact, these emissions are much more analogous to the aurorae detected from the magnetized planets in our Solar System, generated by powerful, magnetospheric current systems that lead to downward precipitation of energetic particles into the high-latitude regions of the upper atmosphere. The resulting emissions from planets, and now brown dwarfs, include intense radio emission produced by the downward precipitating electrons, and a myriad of continuum and line emission in the infrared, optical and ultraviolet associated with the collisional excitation and ionization of the upper atmosphere. In the case of optical (Keck) and radio (VLA) observations of one M9 dwarf, the dissipated power associated with these aurorae is 1e6 times larger than those produced in the Jovian magnetosphere. As well as signalling a transition in magnetic activity at the end of the main sequence, auroral currents may play a causal role in modifying atmospheric temperature and opacity in near infrared bands, relating to recent reports of weather phenomena on cool brown dwarfs. Notably, the radio emission is a particularly powerful diagnostic and has most recently allowed us to extend magnetic field strength measurements into the late L and T dwarf regime, with potential to extend this further into the exoplanetary regime. To this end, my group has built a new radio telescope at Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory, involving the full cross-correlation of 288 dipole antennas, that allows us to image the entire viewable hemisphere every second in the search for similar auroral radio emission from extrasolar planets.

Deep exposures with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have provided the primary evidence that star-forming galaxies were present in the first billion years of cosmic history. Sometime during this early period the intergalactic medium transitioned from a neutral gas to one that is fully ionized. How did this `cosmic reionization' occur and were star-forming galaxies responsible? The electron scattering optical depth inferred from cosmic microwave background observations suggests that reionization occurred sometime in the redshift interval z=20 to z=6 so probing the abundance, luminosity distribution and spectral properties of galaxies during this uncharted period holds the key to addressing these fundamental questions. Recent imaging with HST's Wide Field Camera 3 in conjunction with Spitzer photometry and Keck spectroscopy has provided important new insight into understanding when reionization occurred and the role of early galaxies in the process. I will review this progress and discuss the remaining challenges ahead of future facilities such as TMT and JWST.

The two most popular models to explain the bipolar or multi-polar morphologies commonly seen in planetary nebulae (PNe) and Post-AGB stars (PAGBs) are the binary interaction between a mass-losing AGB star and a close companion, or magnetic collimation of the wind. The magnetic model has been favored in recent years because of detections (and measurements) of different maser species, and observations of synchrotron emission. A third detection technique is the analysis of dust polarization at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. I shall therefore present our work on the determination of the location and orientation of the magnetic field via the process of dust grain alignment.

These excitations in materials may have important potential applications for the future of conventional or quantum computation. I will describe experiments with scanning tunneling microscopes to probe these topological quasi-particle states using high-resolution atomic scale spectroscopic techniques. Among the experiments I will discuss are those that focus on the edge modes of topological insulators, and current efforts to realize a topological superconducting phase in nanometer-sized atomic chains fabricated on the surface of a superconductor.

For silicon slid against diamond, the shape evolution and volume loss due to wear closely fit a kinetic model based on stress-assisted bonding mechanisms. This allows new insights to be gained about the kinetics of atomic-scale wear.

External stressors are real, yet how we choose to view, experience and manage them is an internal process. To maintain a healthy level of stress, we must cultivate an ability to remain flexible and open in order to adapt and adjust to challenges. This workshop will examine common traits of resilient people, and explore ways to strengthen our own resiliency skills. We introduce the concept of managing our energy instead of managing our time as the foundation for healthy practices, high performance, and sustained personal renewal.

Participants will have the opportunity to:
Define and discuss resilience
Identify the common traits of resilient people
Assess their own level of resilience and identify steps to strengthen their skills
Explore the four quadrants of personal energy and engagement
Discuss examples of practices that support a healthy energy management plan

The Scientist in the Crib: How Babies and Young Children Think (BEUHS342),Workshop,2014-04-02T20:10:00+00:00,2014-04-02T21:30:00+00:00,"Tang Center, University Health Services, Section Club",,Work/Life,"Speaker/Performer: Alison Gopnik, Professor of Psychology, UC Berkeley
In the last thirty years there has been a revolution in our scientific understanding of babies and young children that has also transformed our understanding of human nature itself. In this talk, Professor Gopnik will outline some of the new discoveries and their implications for the way we think about young children and ourselves.
Human beings have a longer childhood than any other animal  our children are more helpless and dependent than any others. Why make babies so helpless for so long? Professor Gopnik will talk about how childhood is responsible for our uniquely human consciousness and our ability to learn, imagine and love and how this long protected childhood gives human babies an opportunity to learn, play and plan and work as adults.
In their unstoppable pretend play, preschoolers use their discoveries to imagine new ways that the world might be. Children not only learn about the world around them, they also learn about other people and themselves. By the time they are three or four they understand love and morality. These remarkable learning abilities reflect special features of babies brains - features that may actually make babies more conscious than adults.
Alison Gopnik is a professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley. She received her BA from McGill University and her PhD from Oxford University. She is an internationally recognized leader in the study of childrens learning and development and was the first to argue that childrens minds could help us understand deep philosophical questions. She is the author of over 100 journal articles and several books . She has also written widely about cognitive science and psychology for Science, The Times Literary Supplement, the New York Times, New Scientist and Slate, among others. Professor Gopnik has frequently appeared on TV and radio including, The Charlie Rose Show and The Colbert Report.

Yet this universal human experience was so basic, that it wasn't studied much until recent decades.

In order to get better sleep, it helps to better ""get"" sleep.

sleep needs and changes over the life cycle
the relationship between sleep and stress

For a finite index sublattice of the root lattice An, we answer this question by constructing a deterministic algorithm to deform the lattice ideal to a nearby generic lattice ideal. Our algorithm is based on recent results of Perkinson, Perlman and Wilmes concerning commutative algebraic aspects of chip firing on directed graphs. As an application of our deformation algorithm, we construct a cellular resolution of the lattice ideals by degenerating the Scarf complex of its deformation. This is joint work with Spencer Backman.

Abstract: If \(\Lambda \subset (M \times N, (-\omega _M) \oplus \omega _N)\) is a Lagrangian correspondence, then Wehrheim--Woodward construct an \(A_\infty \)-functor \(F_\Lambda ^\#: Fuk(M) \to Fuk^\#(N)\) that sends \(L \subset M\) to the formal composition \((L, \Lambda )\). In work-in-progress with Katrin Wehrheim, we aim to construct an \(A_\infty \)-functor \(F_\Lambda : Fuk(M) \to Fuk(N)\) that sends \(L \subset M\) to the geometric composition \(L \circ \Lambda \subset N\), and is defined on the morphism level in terms of singular quilts. These singular quilts have the same sort of singularity as figure eight bubbles, which appear in the analysis of strip-shrinking. Toward a Fredholm theory for these singular quilts, we prove a collection of elliptic estimates, two consequences of which are a Gromov compactness theorem for strip-shrinking and a removal of singularity for figure eight bubbles.

Abstract: In this talk, we will use hyperK\""ahler geometry to define the reduced open Gromov-Witten invariants on hyperKahler manifolds. These invariants can have non-trivial wall-crossing phenomenon and are expected to be the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants in the construction of hyperK\""ahler metric due to Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke. As an application, these invariants can help to establish a correspondence between holomorphic discs and tropical discs. The invariant can also help to study certain discs counting invariants for Calabi-Yau 3-folds with K3 fibration.

A program that computes all four zeros of a real quartic polynomial, and does so well enough to be included in a Math. library, has to overcome failure modes that afflict all the obvious candidates, like
 MATLAB's roots(C) and text-book formulas centuries old. Most of those failure modes are due to roundoff. How can they be found and, preferably, overcome without carrying extravagantly high precision?

							UC Berkeley",Department of Mathematics,"A large finite graph $G$ gives rise to a probability measure on subgraphs of a given size by sampling vertices uniformly and independently from $G$. We say a sequence of finite graphs $\langle G_i\rangle _{i\in \omega }$ converges if for every finite graph $H$, the probability of sampling $H$ from $G_i$ converges as $i\rightarrow \infty $. But what does it converge to? Any convergent sequence of finite graphs gives rise to a measure on the space of countable labeled graphs which is invariant under relabeling, and this measure can be viewed as the limit object. Alternatively, a graphon is a more concrete analytic object which encodes the same asymptotic properties. I will describe the natural generalization of each of these perspectives to higher arity relational structures. In particular, higher arity graphons can be described in model theoretic language, suggesting further connections with logic.

To describe the stochastic environment in descriptive or prescriptive models, it is implicitly assumed that enough data will be available to guarantee the validity of a decision or the consistency of a statistical estimate. Unfortunately, in a real life environment the data

available is rarely enough to reach the asymptotic range, either

because it is not available or there is not enough time to collect an

adequate database before decisions or estimates must be produced.

One serious shortcoming is our ability to systematically blend data and

non data information, in other words, our inability to deal with the

fusion of hard and soft information. The lecture deals with these

challenges and how optimization technology can be surprisingly

effective in this context.

Suppose we do not impose stochastic models on how stock prices will evolve in the future. Is it possible, by active trading, to do better than a market index (say, S&P 
500)? The answer to this question is surprisingly tight. If we restrict ourselves to strategies that are functions of the current stock prices, there is exactly one class of trading strategies that achieves this goal. More remarkably, these strategies are produced as solutions of Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem on the multidimensional unit simplex with a cost function that can be described as the log partition function. The ideas are an interplay between convex analysis, probability theory, and the geometry of the unit simplex. We will also show how this theory explains the presence of statistical arbitrage in high-frequency trading. Based on joint work with Leonard Wong.

							University of Reading",Department of Mathematics,"Although the mathematics of ice sheet dynamics is well-established, the prediction of profiles and grounding movement are analytically infeasible and numerically difficult to achieve. Here we present a new `moving-mesh' approach to simulating ice sheets and glaciers computationally that is driven by ice diffusion movement and successfully reproduces the features of ice-flow, including advance and retreat. The method is applied to a shallow ice model of a glacier using data from one of the EISMINT test cases and the results are compared. We then show how assimilation of measured data can be used within the moving framework to improve the prediction of ice sheet movement. We develop a procedure for treating the mesh point positions, together with the ice thickness, as unknown state variables within the assimilation system. The correlation between the unknown mesh positions and the ice thickness is approximated by a simple correlation function that provides flow dependent co-variances. We demonstrate the success of the technique for noisy, very infrequent, partial measurements of ice thickness, both with and without noisy measurements of the position of the flow boundary.

							Michigan State",Department of Mathematics,"There is a rational valued invariant of an automorphism of a surface with a single boundary component called the fractional Dehn twist coefficient. Roughly, it measures the twisting of the automorphism around the boundary. The fractional Dehn twist coefficient is related to the theory of taut foliations, essential laminations, and contact structures on 3-manifolds obtained by performing Dehn surgery on fibered knots. These connections arise by associating to a fibered knot in a 3-manifold the fractional Dehn twist coefficient of the monodromy of the fibration on its complement. I'll describe how the Heegaard Floer homology of a 3-manifold bounds the fractional Dehn twist coefficient of any of its fibered knots, and some consequences this has for contact structures on 3-manifolds.

A common theme in the lectures is the replacement of classical blow-up arguments by a multiscale analysis in which one does not pass to the blow-up limit. A key point is that the special structure that exists in a blow-up limit (a.k.a. a tangent cone) is already present to any given degree of approximation at ""most"" locations and scales.

							North Carolina State University",Department of Mathematics,"This talk will focus upon stratified spaces arising from total positivity theory and combinatorial representation theory. We prove that certain such stratified spaces having the Bruhat orders as their posets of closure relations are regular CW complexes homeomorphic to closed balls. A special case is the link of the identity matrix in the space of upper triangular, totally nonnegative matrices with 1's on the diagonal, stratified according to which minors are positive and which are 0. This confirms a conjecture of Fomin and Shapiro. I will briefly discuss some ingredients that went into the proof, including the role of the 0-Hecke algebra of a Coxeter group as well as a new criterion for deciding if a finite CW complex is regular with respect to a choice of characteristic maps; this is based on an interplay of combinatorics with topology. I will then relate this to a second, more traditionally topological approach (joint work in progress with Jim Davis and Ezra Miller) based on the CE approximation theorem and local contractibility of the space of homeomorphisms from a sphere to itself. The totally nonnegative spaces under consideration may be regarded as images of maps from polytopes which are generically injective, with fibers of these maps encoding relations among exponentiated Chevalley generators. As time permits, I will indicate how the subword complexes of Knutson and Miller encapsulate the combinatorics of these fibers, how reduced and nonreduced words give rise to a flow to a base point within each fiber, and ways in which this picture could perhaps be generalized.

							UC Davis",Department of Mathematics,"In the study of the intricate dynamics of many-body systems it is often convenient, or actually unavoidable, to resort to simpler approximate descriptions. For quantum-mechanical many-body systems of bosons it is possible to use effective one-particle equations to track the microscopic evolution of many-particle states in appropriate regimes. Many sophisticated results are available for the case of fixed volume, however, regimes in the direction of the thermodynamic limit seem fairly unexplored. I will report on a recent joint work with J. Froehlich, P. Pickl, and A. Pizzo in which we consider an interacting Bose-gas at zero temperature in the regime of large volume V, large gas density rho, and small ratio V/rho; the coupling constant of the pair-potential being comparable to 1/rho. We derive an effective non-linear equation for the time evolution of coherent order one excitations above the ground state of the condensate and provide an explicit error bound in terms of density and volume. The effective equation allows an immediate discussion of the dispersion of small excitations. For repulsive potentials we recover Bogolyubov's well-known formula for the speed of sound in the gas, and for attractive potentials we show a dynamical instability.

I will explain how this formalism may be reformulated in a way that naturally generalizes from non-commutative to non-associative geometry. In the process, several of the standard axioms of NCG are conceptually reinterpreted. This reformulation also suggests a new constraint on the class of NCGs used to describe the standard model of particle physics. Remarkably, this new condition resolves a long-standing puzzle about the embedding of the standard model in NCG, by precisely eliminating from the action formula the collection of seven unwanted terms that previously had to be removed by an extra (empirically-motivated, ad hoc) assumption.

In this talk we show how the limiting behavior of large networks can be exploited for nonparametric statistical inference. We introduce the notion of a network histogram, obtained by fitting a stochastic blockmodel to a single observation of a network dataset. Blocks of edges play the role of histogram bins, and community sizes that of histogram bandwidths or bin sizes. Working within the framework of exchangeable arrays subject to bond percolation, we prove consistency of network histogram estimation under general conditions, giving rates of convergence which include the important practical setting of sparse networks.

We will exploit a well-known connection (Bertoin, Le Gall '06) between critical continuous-state branching processes (CSBP) that are absorbed at $0$ and the generalized Smoluchowski coagulation equation to prove a variety of limit theorems. We establish a fundamental connection between the existence of a non-degenerate scaling limit and regular variation (at $0$) of the branching mechanism. In particular, we show:

 1. A non-degenerate scaling limit of a critical CSBP (absorbed at $0$) exists if and only if the branching mechanism is regularly varying at 0.
 2. The CDF of the rescaled process conditioned on survival has a nondegenerate limit if and only if the branching mechanism is regularly at $0$.
When the scaling limits exist, we can further characterise the nondegenerate scaling limits of arbitrary finite-measure solutions in terms of generalized Mittag-Leffler series.

The talk will present results of a joint project with surgeons in the field of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery.

The questions treated by mathematicians are:

(1) operation planning within teleconferences of ZIB and the clinic, based on a detailed geometric model of skull and facial tissue,

(2) prediction of the facial appearance on the basis of numerical simulation of the patient's soft tissue, based on fast adaptive multilevel finite element methods for the elastomechanic partial differential equations, either the linear Navier-Lamé equations or nonlinear enrichments like geometric nonlinearity or nonlinear material laws of Ogden type.

As is well-known, nonlinear mechanics leads to nonconvex optimization. Extensions of affine conjugate Newton methods for convex optimization problems to the nonconvex case here (more precisely: polyconvex case) are given.

Geometric Representation Theory: What is the [Categorical] Weil Representation?,Seminar,2014-03-13T17:30:00+00:00,2014-03-13T19:00:00+00:00,891 Evans Hall,"Shamgar Gurevich,

							U of Wisconsin, Madison",Department of Mathematics,"Given a symplectic vector space V over a finite field (of odd characteristic) one can construct a ""quantum"" Hilbert space H(L) attached to a Lagrangian subspace L in V. In addition, one can construct a Fourier Transform T(M,L): H(L)→H(M), for every pair of Lagrangians (L,M), such that T(N,M)T(M,L)=T(N,L), for every triples (L,M,N) of Lagrangians. This can be used to construct a canonical model H(V) for the famous Weil representation of the symplectic group Sp(V).

In the lecture I will give elementary introduction to the above constructions, and discuss the categorification of these Fourier transforms, what is the related sign problem, and what is its solution. The outcome is a natural category acted by the algebraic group G=Sp, obtaining the categorical Weil representation.

In Computer Vision and multi-view geometry one considers several cameras in general position as a collection of projection maps. One would like to understand how to reconstruct the 3-dimensional image from the 2-dimensional projections. [Hartley-Zisserman] (and others such as Alzati-Tortora and Papadopoulo-Faugeras) described several natural multi-linear (or tensorial) constraints which record certain relations between the cameras such as the epipolar, trifocal, and quadrifocal tensors. (Don't worry, I will stop at quadrifocal tensors!)
A greater understanding of these tensors is needed for Computer Vision, and Algebraic Geometry and Representation Theory provide some answers. I will describe a uniform construction of the epipolar, trifocal and quadrifocal tensors via equivariant projections of a Grassmannian. Then I will use the beautiful Algebraic Geometry and Representation Theory, which naturally arrises in the construction, to recover some known information (such as symmetry and dimensions) and some new information (such as defining equations).

							Cornell University",Department of Mathematics,"The Grassmannian $Gr(k,n)$ of $k$-planes in $n$-space has a stratification that can be defined in at least five different ways:

{\it Poisson geometry.} There is a natural holomorphic Poisson structure, with respect to which the strata are exactly the torus-invariant Poisson subvarieties.

{\it The cyclic Bruhat decomposition.} If we rotate the columns of a $k\times n$ matrix, where can the pivot columns (in the sense of Gaussian row-reduction) be, for the $n$ rotations? The different possibilities exactly define these strata.

{\it Positive real geometry.} Very few matroid strata intersect the semialgebraic locus where all the Plücker coordinates are no negative. The closures of those that do give this stratification.

{\it Projected Richardson varieties.} The full flag manifold has a similarly nice decomposition, rather simply given by the intersections of Schubert and opposite Schubert varieties. But magically, when we project it to $Gr(k,n)$ it acquires this cyclic symmetry.

{\it Characteristic $p$ geometry.} If we consider $n$-space over a perfect field of characteristic $p$, there is a natural ""Frobenius splitting"" giving a sort of $p$th root operator on the sheaf of functions. Such an operator always stabilizes only finitely many ideals, and on the Grassmannian those ideals correspond to these strata.

And best of all, the most natural way to index these strata is by juggling patterns, which I will define and demonstrate; they are a class of permutations in the affine Weyl group of type A. I'll explain the geometric connection to the affine flag manifold, which requires juggling antimatter (which I won't demonstrate).

							ANU",Department of Mathematics,"Bökstedt defined topological Hochschild homology ($THH$) before the advent of the modern categories of spectra in use today, and he had to invent some rather complicated coherence machinery to mimic the algebraic definition of Hochschild homology. It was thought that a “naive” definition of $THH$ using a modern category of spectra could never give the correct equivariant homotopy type. We compare the Bökstedt smash product to the norm construction from the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel proof of the Kervaire Invariant One problem, and use that to show that using the category of orthogonal spectra we do get a sensible definition of $THH$. This simplifies the foundations and makes it possible to define things like Adams operations on $THH(A)$ and $TC(A)$. This is joint work with Blumberg, Gerhardt, Hill, Lawson and Mandell.

Models based on potential outcomes, also known as counterfactuals, were introduced by Neyman (1923) and later applied to observational contexts by Rubin (1974). Such models are now used extensively within Biostatistics, Statistics, Political Science, Economics, and Epidemiology for reasoning about causation. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), introduced by Wright (1921) are another formalism used to represent causal systems. Graphs are also extensively used in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Sociology and Epidemiology.

In this talk, I will present a simple approach to unifying these two frameworks via a new graph, termed the Single-World Intervention Graph (SWIG). The SWIG encodes the counterfactual independencies associated with a specific hypothetical intervention on a set of treatment variables. The nodes on the SWIG are the corresponding counterfactual random variables. The SWIG is derived from a causal DAG via a simple node splitting transformation. I will illustrate the theory with a number of examples. Finally I show that SWIGs avoid a number of pitfalls that are present in an alternative approach to unification, based on twin networks that has been advocated by Pearl (2000).

One of the classical optimization models for image segmentation is the well-known Markov Random Fields (MRF) model. The MRF problem involves minimizing pairwise-separation and singleton-deviation terms. This model is shown here to be powerful in representing classical problems of ranking, group decision making and clustering. The techniques presented are stronger than continuous techniques used in image segmentation, such as total variations, denoising, level sets and some classes of Mumford-Shah functionals. This is manifested both in terms of running time and in terms of quality of solution for the prescribed optimization problem.
We present the first known efficient, and flow-based, algorithms for the convex MRF (the non-convex is shown to be NP-hard). We then discuss the power of the MRF model and algorithms in the context of aggregate ranking. The aggregate ranking problem is to obtain a ranking that is fair and representative of the individual decision makers' rankings. We argue here that using cardinal pairwise comparisons provides several advantages over score-wise or ordinal models. The aggregate group ranking problem is formalized as the MRF model and is linked to the inverse equal paths problem. This combinatorial approach is shown to have advantages over other pairwise-based methods for ranking, such as PageRank and the principal eigenvector technique.

One of the most important problems in the study of MCF is to understand all possible singularities that flow may go through. On the other hand, it is well known that self-shrinkers (i.e., self-shrinking solutions of MCF) are models of singularities of the flow. In this talk, we will discuss the asymptotic geometry of two-dimensional noncompact self-shrinkers.

 University of California, Berkeley
Identifying gene interactions has been one of the major tasks in understanding biological
processes. However, due to the difficulty in characterizing/inferring different types of
biological gene relationships, as well as several computational issues arising from dealing
with high‐dimensional biological data, finding groups of interacting genes remains
challenging. In this work we elucidate higher‐level gene‐gene interactions (i.e., gene
group interactions) by evaluating conditional dependencies between genes, i.e., the
relationships between genes after removing the influences of a set of other functionally
related genes. The detailed technique involves performing sparse canonical correlation
analysis with repeated subsampling and random partition. This technique is especially
unique and powerful in evaluating conditional dependencies when the correct
dependent sets are unknown or only partially known. When used effectively, this is a
promising technique to recover gene relationships that would have otherwise been
missed by standard methods. In addition, comparisons with other methods using
simulated and real data show this method achieves considerably lower false positive
rates.

							Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, NYU",Department of Mathematics,"MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) is the main tool in much modern computation in statistics and statistical physics. The auto-correlation time of an MCMC method is, roughly speaking, the number of MCMC ""sweeps"" needed to product an effectively independent sample. Variables with large correlations, for example, give long auto-correlation times in MCMC methods that move variables one at a time (single variable Metropolis), or methods that propose isotropic (i.e. uncorrelated) multivariate moves. These situations can be improved by affine transformations of the sample space, chosen to reduce correlations. We discuss two classes of MCMC samplers that are affine invariant, which means that they have the same with or without an affine pre-conditioning. One (with Jonathan Weare) involves ensembles of samples being updated together. The samplers can be affine invariant if the moves are based on relative positions of different samples. One of these is the basis of the Emcee Hammer software package distributed by Dan Foreman Mackey. The other (with Bo Zhu) is an MCMC version of Gauss Newton Marquardt Levenberg nonlinear least squares, which gets its affine invariance by using derivative information.

In the polynomial situation, solvability is no longer ensured by simple conditions on $D$, and in fact may be considered “exceptional."" In our treatment, we let $D(t)=D_L(t)$ vary over a pencil. In the particular case where $D_L(t)=t^6+t+L$, our results imply that the Pell equation is solvable with nonzero $Y(t)$ only for finitely many complex values of L.

We compare the Bökstedt smash product to the norm construction from the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel proof of the Kervaire Invariant One problem, and use that to show that using the category of orthogonal spectra we do get a sensible definition of THH.

							Regensburg",Department of Mathematics,"In 1986 Peter May made the following conjecture:

Suppose that $R$ is a ring spectrum with power operations (e.g., an $E_\infty $ring spectrum/ commutative $S$-algebra). Then the torsion elements in the kernel of the integral Hurewicz homomorphism $\pi _* R\rightarrow H_* (R;\mathbb {Z})$ are nilpotent.

If $R$ is the sphere spectrum, this is Nishida's nilpotence theorem. If we strengthen the condition on the integral homology to a condition about the complex bordism of $R$, then this is a special case of the nilpotence theorem of Devinatz, Hopkins, and Smith.

The proof is short and simple, using only results that have been around since the late 90's. As a corollary we obtain results on the non-existence of commutative $S$-algebra structures on various quotients of $MU$. For example $MU/(p^i)$ or $ku/(p^i v)$ for $i>0$. We also obtain new results about the behavior of the Adams spectral sequence for Thom and THH spectra.

Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in computer
science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will likely lead to a
new wave of technological innovations in communication, computation and cryptography.
As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally stochastic, randomness and
uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum
information. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum computation and
quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to revolutionize computational statistics. 
This talk will give a brief review on quantum computation, introduce quantum tomography and 
compressed sensing and present my recent work on their statistical connections.

The Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansion has evolved into the workhorse of functional data analysis: the Fourier representation it affords on the one hand serves as a basis for motivating methodology by analogy to multivariate statistics; and, on the other hand, appears as the natural means of regularization in problems such as regression, testing and prediction, which are ill-posed in the functional case. With the aim of obtaining a similarly canonical representation of dependent functional data, we develop a doubly spectral analysis of a stationary functional stochastic process, decomposing it into an integral of uncorrelated functional frequency components (Cramér representation), each of which is in turn expanded into a KL series. This Cramér-Karhunen-Loève representation separates temporal from intrinsic curve variation, and it is seen to yield a harmonic principal component analysis when truncated: a finite dimensional proxy of the time series that optimally captures both within and between curve variation. Empirical versions are introduced, and a rigorous analysis of their large-sample behaviour is provided under Brillinger-type mixing conditions. Our work is motivated by and applied to the study of the molecular dynamics of short strands of DNA; specifically, we consider the problem of determining whether the dynamics of such strands in solution are significantly affected by small perturbations of their base-pair composition, based on molecular dynamics simulations.

							Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP",Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE),"International building codes typically tend to offer only a limited number of prescriptive design options for the seismic load resisting systems of high-rise structures. This, inevitably and unfortunately, has tended to restrict the creativity of designers, leading to a preponderance of boxy tall buildings, particularly in seismic regions. Codes do, however, offer opportunities for designers to use more strenuous but rewarding non-prescriptive design methodologies to develop and substantiate unique lateral system solutions. These methodologies, typically involving performance based design, rely on engineering first principles, non-linear analysis, and sometimes testing
to accomplish desired ends. This talk will illustrate, using examples in regions of moderate and high seismicity, the integrated evolution of unique non-prescriptive high-rise structural systems and innovations in response to the specific architectural program, environmental control system, and aesthetic challenges in each case.

It is also the name of an exciting and rapidly growing subarea of quantum information science, which focuses on the interplay between condensed matter physics and the theory of computation. The starting point of this area is the curious fact that a central problem in theoretical computer science, called the ""constraint satisfaction problem"", is a special case of a central problem in condensed matter physics, namely, finding ground states of local Hamiltonians. This intriguing link suggests a computational lens on many-body quantum physics, a viewpoint which has already led to a rich set of new questions and insights. In my talk I will survey some ideas related to the main questions underlying this exciting direction:

*Can states of natural quantum systems be described succinctly?
*Does the exponential complexity of general quantum systems persist at high temperature?
*Is the scientific method sufficiently powerful to test and understand general quantum systems?

No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics or quantum computation will be assumed.

Engineering needs, economic forces and environmental factors are the main drivers of this transformation. The vision is to build a smart electrical grid and a smarter market mechanism around it to fulfill mandates on clean energy. Looking at engineering and economic issues in isolation is no longer an option today; it needs an integrated design approach. This talk will give some examples of research projects that address this evolving area of research. In particular, it would focus on optimizations over power networks and Cournot equilibrium in electricity markets. The goal is to demonstrate that modern optimization, controls, game theory and microeconomics together can provide unique insights into this complex system and the ideas often generalize to other application domains.

After Hurricane Sandy, Palantir Technologies, along with NGOs Direct Relief and Team Rubicon, committed to innovate new technology tools for humanitarian responders. During the response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, they recognized the need to gather information in real-time from areas without cellular coverage---and Palantir MIMOSA was born.Using only off-the-shelf hardware, Palantir MIMOSA allows for real-time tracking of personnel, two-way communications, and structured data submission from anywhere in the world, regardless of cellular connectivity. Brian Fishman, who leads Palantir's Disaster Response work, will explain Palantir's work in this area, along with Palantir's broader philanthropy program, which in addition to disaster response, focuses on countering human trafficking, supporting veterans organizations, and uncovering illicit networks, such as arms smugglers.

Engineering 3D multicellular microenvironments to direct stem cell differentiation & morphogenesis

Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University

Stem cells offer tremendous promise as the basis of regenerative therapies due to their inherent capacity for differentiation into various cell types and their potent ability to secrete a unique cadre of morphogenic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory factors. Engineering the properties of 3D stem cell microenvironments offers a means of regulating their fate and function in an analogous format to the multicellular organization of primitive developing tissues. Simple multicellular aggregates of stem cells permit differentiation and morphogenesis of complex tissue structures, as demonstrated by numerous recent organoid examples, and are directly amenable to scalable suspension culture techniques. Thus, we have taken a systematic approach to the engineering of pluripotent and multipotent stem cell aggregates in order to examine the effects of biophysical and biochemical cues on cell fate, morphogenesis, and secretory function for the purposes of creating in vitro model systems, developing scalable biomanufacturing technologies, and directing innate trophic delivery and regenerative potential. We have demonstrated through a series of studies that hydrodynamic forces created within mixed suspension culture can modulate differentiation and extracellular matrix and growth factor expression of homogeneous populations of pluripotent stem cell aggregates. We have also pioneered the incorporation of different types of biomaterials within 3D aggregates of stem cells as a means of spatiotemporally controlling the delivery of exogenous factors and sequestering of endogenous morphogens that impact stem cell phenotype. More recently we have developed quantitative analytical methods and computational modeling approaches to assess the cellular composition, mechanical properties and patterns of differentiation within single aggregates to complement our experimental efforts to dissect the mechanisms regulating stem cell fate decisions. The sum of these strategies is intended to enhance our understanding of the governing principles dictating stem cell morphogenesis and ultimately translate the potential of stem cells into viable cell-based therapies and diagnostics that transform the future of biomedical research and healthcare practices.

Advances in drone aircraft, networked cameras, and recent disclosures about the NSAs international and domestic surveillance activities have stimulated public protests, outrage from activists, and new policy discussions among elected leaders. This symposium will highlight emerging perspectives on visual privacy and consider the state of the art from a variety of disciplines and professions, including technology, journalism, filmmaking and the arts.

Though traditionally considered separate domains, visual and digital surveillance practices are being combined as machine vision, facial recognition and other technologies become more sophisticated and interoperable. Institutional surveillance by semi-autonomous drones and remote cameras, citizen video monitoring, and incessant photo-sharing and tagging on social networks enable perpetual documentation. The same tools can be used for both transparency and repression.

This symposium will bring together scholars and practitioners from a range of disciplines to discuss privacy protections, surveillance methods, and modes of resistance in a digital age. The program will feature two keynote addresses and two panel discussions that will explore emerging surveillance technologies and applications across a range of contexts, and then turn to resistant strategies employed by individuals and organizations in response.

We are in the age of networks and networked systems: communication, transportation, economic, biological, healthcare, educational, human, social, web-based, etc. This evolution and reality have created unprecedented advances and are impacting every aspect of life and work. However, many of these advances, and resulting expanding markets, are critically endangered by weaknesses in security, integrity and trust. We investigate the complex and polymorphic subject of trust in these distributed systems and describe a new framework using multiple partially ordered semirings for analyzing reputation and trust establishment, dynamics as well as composite trust. This framework is inspired by thinking of trust problems as path problems in networks. Next we describe our work based on constrained coalitional games towards understanding the role of trust in collaboration and social networks. We describe several specific applications of these methods in securing distributed inference systems, sensor networks for power grids, wireless network routing protocols, distributed control systems. We close by describing challenges and future research directions.

 Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University
Taking inspiration from Tiqqun's 2001 text the cybernetic hypothesis, this talk examines the relationship between digital technology and scholarly research methods. A definition of the cybernetic hypothesis is presented by way of a series of historical investigations into the work of Lewis Richardson, Warren Weaver, John von Neumann, and Paul Otlet. Cybernetics is defined thus in terms of a broad set of assumptions and techniques influencing society and culture at large. These assumptions and techniques include an epistemology rooted in arrays or systems containing discrete entities, the organization of entities into systems, and the regularization of difference or asymmetry within the system overall. After having presented this view of cybernetics, we examine the challenges and problems such a paradigm presents to scholarly research methods including contemporary developments in the digital humanities. In other words, what kind of intellectual work is possible after the rise of digital media?

The musculoskeletal system is comprised of large load bearing soft tissues that absorb and distribute the complex loads placed on the joint. The intervertebral disc is comprised of mechanically and structurally unique substructures including the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus, which function together to support and absorb spinal loads.
Disc degeneration occurs as early as the second decade of life and contributes to over $130 billion in medical costs. Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes.
Noninvasive techniques to measure internal mechanical properties will be discussed. Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion. One approach to biological repair strategies that will be discussed is to cultivate engineered tissue in vitro, permitting some elaboration of extracellular matrix for improved long-term outcome following in vivo implantation.

The Design of Nanoscale Therapeutics and Nanostructured Materials

Ravi Kane
P. K. Lashmet Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute

This talk will describe our efforts to interface bioactive molecules with nanomaterials and nanoscale scaffolds for designing potent therapeutics and functional nanocomposites.

The design of polyvalent molecules presenting multiple copies of a specific ligand represents a promising strategy to inhibit pathogens and bacterial toxins. We will first describe the design of polyvalent inhibitors that are orders of magnitude more active than the corresponding monovalent molecules and can neutralize anthrax toxin in vivo. We recently described a thermodynamic analysis to help clarify the theoretical basis for the large enhancements in avidity due to polyvalency. We have used this understanding to guide the structure-based design of potent synthetic polyvalent ligands. The ability to control independently the valency and the spacing between ligands is particularly valuable for these design efforts. To that end, we recently designed monodisperse polypeptide-based polyvalent inhibitors of anthrax toxin in which multiple copies of an inhibitory toxin-binding peptide were separated by flexible peptide linkers. By tuning the valency and linker length, we designed polyvalent inhibitors that were over four orders of magnitude more potent than the corresponding monovalent ligands. Studies relating the composition and structure of polyvalent inhibitors to their activity have also shed light on fundamental aspects of polyvalent recognition, including the role of pattern matching. We will also discuss other applications of polyvalent molecules ranging from the inhibition of pathogens (e.g., the influenza virus) to controlling the nanoscale organization of cellular receptors to regulate signaling and stem cell fate.
In addition to the inhibition of bacterial toxins, we are also investigating approaches to target pathogenic bacteria. In particular, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has been a growing concern. We have been exploring an enzyme-based approach to combat pathogenic bacteria. We will describe an approach that we have developed to identify novel bacteriolytic enzymes targeting a variety of bacterial pathogens. We have also investigated the structure and function of these and other enzymes when immobilized onto nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes. Our studies indicate that the nanoscale environment can significantly influence the activity and stability of these proteins. We have used the highly stable and active nanomaterial-protein conjugates to form nanocomposite films that are effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).

The advent of mobile health (mHealth) technology brings great opportunity to improve quality of life, improve individual and public health, and reduce healthcare costs. Although mHealth devices and applications are proliferating, many challenges remain to provide the necessary usability, manageability, interoperability, availability, security, and privacy. The vision of the Amulet project is that computational jewelry, in a form like a bracelet or pendant, will provide the properties essential for successful body-area mHealth networks. These devices coordinate the activity of the body-area network and provide a discreet means for communicating with their wearer. Such devices complement the capabilities of a smartphone, bridging the gap between the type of pervasive computing possible with a mobile phone and that enabled by wearable computing.

Our interdisciplinary team of investigators is designing and developing Amulet, an electronic bracelet and a software framework that enables developers to create (and users to easily use) safe, secure, and efficient mHealth applications that fit seamlessly into everyday life. The research is determining the degree to which computational jewelry offers advantages in availability, reliability, security, privacy, and usability, and developing techniques that provide these properties in spite of the severely-constrained power resources of wearable jewelry.

decomposing a flow into the fewest number of paths can be solved in
linear time for a family of instances, and biologically relevant
instances tend to fall in this family. We also describe the

Recent research has shown that biologically inspired approaches to materials synthesis and self-assembly, hold promise of unprecedented atomic level control of structures and interfaces. Bones, shells, and teeth are beautiful examples of how natural systems build hard materials by controlling crystallization. Unlike most materials grown in the lab, nature takes advantage of a complex mixture of adsorbates to mediate crystal growth. In this seminar, we will explore some of the surprising mechanisms used to control morphological evolution in biomineral systems and use a similar approach to develop models for predicting shape control in metal and metal-oxide systems.

With the advent of in situ scanning probe microscopy, surface processes can be imaged in real-time, providing a detailed view of how organic molecules interact with atomic steps and surfaces. By using changes in atomic step motion as probes, we learn not only where the organic materials bind to the surface, but also how these binding events affect the kinetics or thermodynamics of crystal growth. Using examples from biomineral, metal, and metal-oxide crystallization we show that organic molecules that modulate growth have a wide variety of behaviors that include pinning step motion, modulating step energies, incorporation into crystals, and enhancing growth rates. Collectively, these effects can be used to control macroscopic crystal shape and growth rate through step- or facet-specific interactions. In this work, we use direct measurements of step and facet dynamics to develop predictive models of shape evolution. These models facilitate the rational design of synergistic combinations of growth modifiers that can be used to create nanostructured materials. Such shape control has the potential to create materials with specific geometries that enhance optical, electrical and magnetic properties and with specific facets that enhance catalytic activity.

 East Bay Bikes (formerly East Bay Bicycle Coalition)
As California works on new guidelines to address transportation projects and CEQA, cities will still need to address the issue aside from CEQA of what level of traffic delay is appropriate to study when designing new bikeways and making pedestrian improvements. If CEQA shifts to vehicle miles traveled or auto trips generated, bikeway projects will essentially be exempt. Yet more than an exemption will be needed to satisfy public concerns. Traffic engineers' responsibilities are changing from 'moving traffic' to designing complete streets, but the solutions are always a compromise, particularly in urban, built-out areas. Bike East Bay (formerly East Bay Bicycle Coalition) is proposing a switch to limiting traffic delay studies to an analysis of how to minimize potential delays on roadways with new proposed bikeways--i.e. no longer using an uncomfortable level of delay as an excuse to block implementation of safe bikeways. Cities in the East Bay such as Concord, Dublin, El Cerrito, Oakland and more are struggling with new regional policies to build walkable, bike able neighborhoods around transit and urban infill areas, while still respecting the reality of traffic congestion that is so familiar to Bay Area commuters. How closely should cities look at traffic delay moving forward? What exact questions should they ask? While eliminating all questions about traffic delay is a likely long-term solution, a phased approach or a modified approach may be needed in an effort to speed up bikeway implementation.

Spherical Nucleic Acids as Programmable Atom Equivalents: Constructing a New &#34;Table of Elements&#34;: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-03-14T22:00:00+00:00,2014-03-14T23:00:00+00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,,Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"Speaker/Performer: Prof. Chad A. Mirkin,

The crystallographic parameters of atomic and ionic solids are fixed by the size and coordination number of their elemental building blocks, thus restricting the types of structures that can be formed. We have demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) as artificial atoms in nanoparticle superlattice assemblies.
These three-dimensional conjugates consist of densely functionalized, highly oriented nucleic acids covalently attached to the surface of inorganic nanoparticles. The strength and length of the programmable DNA bonds between these structures can be adjusted by varying DNA sequence and length, and the properties of the atoms can be adjusted by varying nanoparticle size, shape, and composition.
We have developed design rules for this assembly process, analogous to Paulings Rules for ionic solids but ultimately more powerful. These rules can be used as a guide for the rational construction of functional nanoparticle-based materials for plasmonic, photonic, and catalytic applications.

"What we can learn from reverse engineering biological, molecular machines",Lecture,2014-03-15T19:00:00+00:00,2014-03-15T20:00:00+00:00,159 Mulford Hall,"Troy Lionberger,

							UC Berkeley",Science@Cal,"Mechanical engineers often try to understand how changing a machines design affects its performance. After a hundred years of designing internal combustion engines, for example, we now have the ability to optimize parameters such as fuel efficiency and horsepower. Far removed from the macroscopic world with which we are all familiar lies a new frontier of engineering challenges: molecular motors made of soft, compliant polymers that operate in nanoscale environments. The aim of this talk is to convince you that the enzymes that are essential for life to exist are best described as nanomachines. Like any machine, enzymes function in ways that are intimately tied to their physical design.

The challenge now facing molecular biologists is to understand how an enzymes design is related to how it operates. Addressing this complex problem requires that we first find ways to accurately characterize the behavior of a molecular motor (for example, how fast it moves, how much force it generates, etc.). I will introduce several examples of specialized techniques that make it possible to monitor the real-time motion of single motor proteins with nanometer precision. The single molecule techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools that are providing critical insights into how molecular motors function inside of cells and opening the door to understanding the biological designs that govern their function.

Troy Lionberger is a postdoctoral research associate with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at U.C. Berkeley. He works with Professor Carlos Bustamante to develop single molecule techniques that are used to address questions relating to how genes are turned on and off inside of cells. His primary interest is to understand a fundamental problem that lies at the heart of modern biology: How does a molecular motor known as RNA polymerase transcribe the genetic sequence of DNA into RNA? Dr. Lionberger attended the University of Michigan, earning his Ph.D. in Cellular and Molecular Biology and a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Prior to that, he was an undergraduate at U.C. Berkeley, where he earned degrees in Bioengineering and Molecular and Cell Biology. He is an advocate of science education outreach and volunteers as an instructor at San Quentin State Prison, where he teaches inmates college-level physics, chemistry, and math.

Bioelectronics at the nanoscale: towards seamless integration with cells and tissue,Seminar,2014-03-17T21:00:00+00:00,2014-03-17T22:30:00+00:00,521 Cory Hall,,"Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Speaker/Performer: **Chong Xie**,

Nanostructured devices enable unique opportunities at the interface between the physical and life sciences. In this presentation, I will discuss our recent efforts on seamlessly integrating nanoelectronics with biological cells at the single-cell, cell-network and tissue levels. I will first present our nanopillar-electrode-based action potential recording platform. Action potentials play the central role in nervous and cardio systems. Traditionally, patch clamp and microelectrode array have been used to record action potentials. However, patch clamping suffers the drawback of invasiveness and low throughput, and microelectrode arrays record weak and distorted signals that are difficult to interpret. Nanopillar electrodes can afford high throughput, minimally invasive intracellular action potential recording with high signal-to-noise ratio from cultured cardiomyocytes. Extending the application of nano-devices to the tissue and in-vivo level, I will then discuss how we optimize the brain-electronic interface using nanowire-based 3D macroporous electronics. Conventional brain probes have important limitations, including recording being limited on the probe surface and chronic deterioration of the implant-tissue interface elicited by the mechanical mismatch between implants and brain tissue. I will present the design and implementation of macroporous nanoelectronic brain probes, which can overcome these limitations due to their flexibility and tissue-interpenetrating structure. These works highlight the promise of blurring the distinction between electronic and living systems, and open up significant opportunities in pharmaceutical screening, tissue engineering, brain activity mapping, and brain-machine interface.

 OpenROV
OpenROV is a open-source underwater robot. But it's so much more. It's also a community of people who are working together to create more accessible, affordable, and awesome tools for underwater exploration.
The backbone of the project is the global community of DIY ocean explorers who are working, tinkering and improving the OpenROV design. The community ranges from professional ocean engineers to hobbyists, software developers to students. It's a welcoming community and everyone's feedback and input is valued.

The project started in a garage in Cupertino, with a few guys who wanted to explore an underwater cave. After finding a global community of co-developers on Kickstarter, the project has evolved into a network of connected devices, exploring the oceans and lakes of the world.

Our current healthcare system is belabored with significant inefficiency. This inefficiency includes poor communication among care providers, poor care coordination, poor system interoperability, and poor usability of health information systems. As each of these inefficiencies are addressed through technology such as mobile and cross organizational accesses, these solutions generate new risks to privacy, confidentiality, and security. The changing healthcare climate will be addressed with a focus on patient and provider privacy.

"MSE Department Seminar, Dow Distinguished Lecture Series: Fracture of Silicon Nanopillars during Electrochemical Lithium Insertion",Colloquium,2014-03-21T00:00:00+00:00,2014-03-21T01:00:00+00:00,"Sibley Auditorium, Bechtel Engineering Center",,Materials Science and Engineering (MSE),"Speaker/Performer: William D. Nix,

Understanding the insertion of lithium into silicon electrodes for high capacity lithium-ion batteries is likely to have benefits for mobile energy storage, for both electronics and transportation. Silicon nanostructures have proven to be attractive candidates for electrodes because they provide less constraint on the volume changes that occur and more resistance to fracture during lithium insertion. But still, facture can occur even in nanostructured silicon. Here, we consider the fracture of Si nanopillars during lithiation and find surprising results. We find that fracture is initiated at the surfaces of the crystalline nanopillars and not in the interior, as had been predicted by analyses based on diffusion-induced stresses. In situ transmission electron microscopy observations of initially crystalline Si nanoparticles shows that lithiation occurs by the growth of an amorphous lithiated shell, subjected to tension, at the expense of a crystalline Si core, subjected to compression. We also show that the expansion of the nanopillars is highly anisotropic and that the fracture locations are also anisotropic. In addition, we find a critical fracture diameter for initially crystalline nanopillars of about 300nm that appears to depend on the electrochemical reaction rate. Modeling the stress evolution in Si nanopillars during lithiation provides a way to understand and control these failure processes. Also, we show that initially amorphous Si nanopillars are much more resistant to failure, having much larger critical fracture diameters, because the initial stresses at the surface are compressive in this situation compared to tension in the case of initially crystalline nanopillars. For sufficiently big amorphous Si nanopillars, cracking is expected to be initiated in the interior based on diffusion-induced stresses, but we have not yet observed this kind of fracture. The modeling we, and others, have done has been based largely on estimates or guesses about the mechanical properties of lithiated Si. Recent nanoindentation experiments show that the elastic modulus and hardness of lithiated amorphous Si depend strongly on the lithium content and also show very significant creep effects. These more subtle effects may need to be included in future modeling. It is hoped that these studies will be useful in the design of silicon electrodes for advanced battery systems.

							Professor,

							Zhejiang University",Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS),"The performance of Si-based CMOS ICs has been enhanced over several decades by scaling the transistor size with the Moore's law. The gate length of the transistor has already been scaled down to sub-30 nm. Although Si FinFET device has been developed and show some merits compared with the planar Si MOSFET, the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors(ITRS) is still expecting new high mobility materials to replace Si as channels in order to enhance the device performance further. Actually, in the mass production technologies, new gate oxides, high permittivity(k) gate dielectrics, have been introduced to suppress the unacceptable leakage current of SiO2 gate oxide with the scaling. No matter in high-k gate dielectric engineering or high mobility channel engineering, it is recognized that the MOS interface control technology is of great importance and critical to enhance the device performance. In the early years of my research career, I focused on high-k gate oxide and proposed the phase change technology for obtaining higher-k and more stable high-k lanthanum-based oxides. Recently, my research is mainly about MOS interface properties of strained-Si an Ge MOSFETs. I proposed a universal Coulomb scattering model for strained-Si n and pMOSFETs. This model could also be used to explain the alternated NBTI behaviors in strained-Si pMOSFETs.

Microsystems have the potential to impact biology by providing new ways to manipulate cells. Simply physically manipulating cellsusing microfluidics, electric fields, or optical forcesprovides new ways to separate cells and organize cell-cell interactions.
We have been exploiting microscale electric fields to manipulate cells in a variety of ways. One example is to sort cells based on their intrinsic electrical properties, which we have applied to understand the genetic basis of electrical properties, as well as apply for point-of-care cell-based assays. Another is to use electric fields to guide the growth of axons, which we can do in 3D and in a non-contact fashion, allowing generation of topologically complex in vitro neural networks.
Together, these new microscale tools provide ways to exploit cells potential for both basic science and applied biotechnology.

							UC Berkeley",Center for New Media,"Traditionally used to refer to the degradation of an image when compressed as a digital JPG file, lossy is a state in which digital information is discarded for the sake of file size. Resolution is lost, detail is changed and fineness is compromised. In this process, however, extra pixels may also be added, ultimately transforming and re-authoring the resulting Doppelgänger image. Long interested in issues of analog-to-digital mistranslations, public access, and flows of information and capital, visual artist Stephanie Syjuco will present recent projects exploring the murky territory of the physicality of objects in relationship to virtual space, ""resolution"" as a metaphor for craft, and authorship in an era of co-authored or crowdsourced information. By flipping the loss of original resolution from being a negative condition into a potentially generative one, her works scrutinize how active transformation occurs through misuse and degradation. Perhaps this new, bastard un-original has much more to say by way of poetic narrative, speculative fiction and alternative readings than its static predecessor ever did. Syjuco will also introduce several ongoing projects utilizing online networks such as Facebook, Ebay, Google searches, and Craigslist to explore how the cannibalization of what appear to be limited structures of use and interaction can be leveraged towards critique.

Syjuco is a visual artist and educator who utilizes physical surrogates, counterfeits and digital networks to address the political and social implications of economies and labor in an era of late capitalism. She has participated in numerous exhibitions including at: MoMA/P.S.1, the Whitney Museum of American Art, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Frieze Projects (London), ZKM Center for Art and Technology (Germany), Z33 Space for Contemporary Art (Belgium), Universal Studios Gallery (Beijing) and Garanti Gallery (Istanbul), among others. She is currently collaborating with the FLACC Workplace for Visual Artists in Genk, Belgium, on a new body of work utilizing 3-D scanning of Belgian and Congolese antiquities to produce hybrid objects addressing the legacy of colonialism, empire, and trade routes.

In this talk, I will discuss my lab's work in the emerging field of adversarial stylometry and machine learning. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used in security and privacy domains, in areas that go beyond intrusion or spam detection. For example, in digital forensics, questions often arise about the authors of documents: their identity, demographic background, and whether they can be linked to other documents. The field of stylometry uses linguistic features and machine learning techniques to answer these questions.
We have applied stylometry to difficult domains such as underground hacker forums, open source projects (code), and tweets. In particular, I will discuss our Doppelgänger Finder algorithm, which enables us to group Sybil accounts on underground forums and detect blogs from Twitter feeds. We also have developed a tool, Anonymouth, to help users understand their vulnerability to stylometric analysis and change their writing style.

For decades robots have diligently been tasked to perform a range of roles and duties largely scoped within industrial manufacturing. However, recent trends, motivated in part by high-performance, low-cost hardware, software, and networks have given rise to a new range of more social, personal, expressive, nurturing, and emotional robotic platforms and applications. This has brought with it exciting new opportunities as well as new legal, philosophical, and ethical dilemmas.

Robots are rapidly emerging as extensions of ourselves, enabling us to express ourselves at a distance, extend our creativity, create new objects, empower new communities, and challenge civil rights.

Join us as we deconstruct, debate and explore the concept of robots and new media.

Cancer therapy has a critical unmet need, which is to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients.
There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system.
A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy.
We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. The assay complements current genetic characterizations of tumor variation between individuals and should greatly speed up the testing of new drugs in research settings.
I will demonstrate how bringing these microfluidic devices into the clinic will greatly enabled by the use of stereolithography, a form of 3D printing.

Langley,Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing,"The melding of Darwin's fundamental theory, descent with modification via natural selection with Mendel's particulate theory of inheritance, provided a simple and fertile foundation for the elaboration of population genetics theory in the last century. The lack of direct observations of genetic variation in natural populations fostered creative investigations of diverse models over wide parameter ranges. But now the rapid emergence of empirical population genomic surveys is beginning to profoundly reshape evolution theory. Familiar and embarrassing paradoxes, such as the narrow range average diversity among species, can now be critically addressed. Computational challenges abound from genomic assembly to the rigorous statistical application of standard population genetic theory, such as the inference of gene/genome genealogies. In this context, I shall discuss several of our recent investigations of genomic polymorphism and divergence in Drosophila, including the interactions of natural selection and recombination as well as the impact of fundamental chromatin structure. Discussion of these studies will also serve as examples of the most significant consequence of this transition from what has been an abstract and theoretical population genetics to a structurally and functionally rich population genomics.

The cell membrane is one of the most vital components of a cell; the gate-keeper into and out of the cytoplasm. Studies ranging from neural activity to drug discovery to fundamental cell physiology rely upon controlling electronic or chemical flow across this barrier.
Unfortunately, our ability to artificially control cellular access is surprisingly poor; current techniques often involve creating holes in or puncturing cell membranes that often cause rapid cell death. Yet precise, non-destructive access to the cell interior can lead to an impressive range of new techniques and devices, ranging from neural-prosthetic interfaces, electrical cell monitoring for disease, to rapid drug screening. These types of technologies are particularly important for the recently announced Brain Activity Map and for harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells as disease models and clinical indicators.

One of the critical problems is that we have little knowledge of what happens when the lipid membrane interacts with cell-penetrating materials. Here we explore how inorganic materials with nanoscale molecular functionalization influence and control this vital interface.
We discovered that by selectively tuning the hydrophobicity and flexibility of the molecular functionalization we can replicate many of the design features of natural transmembrane proteins, providing non-disruptive mechanical, electrical and chemical access into the cell. These Stealth probes spontaneously insert into lipid membrane, and form tight lipid-post junctions. Force testing with atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of interfacial adhesion, which surprisingly reveals significant adhesion energy differences between molecular groups with similar hydrophobicity but different mobility. This contradicts traditional hydrophobicity indices as indicators of molecular stability in lipid membranes.

Similarly, we achieved high-efficiency chemical delivery and control by mimicking nature gap junction proteins to create nanostraw arrays. These nanoscale (100-500 nm) diameter straws are formed based on simple water filtration membranes, and spontaneously penetrate cells plated onto them. We find these provide permanent conduits into cells, permitting delivery of a wide variety of materials that could normally not pass through the cell wall.
These two technologies are examples of how the combination of physical sciences and biology can create new beneficial devices that would not be possible in isolation.

A panel of leaders of the sharing economy and shared-use mobility will introduce the burgeoning economy, discuss various forms of shared-use mobility (such as carsharing, public bikesharing, and web-enabled apps) and explore policy issues associated with scaling and with the integration of shared-use mobility services into the transportation landscape (such as privacy, open data, insurance, safety, equity). The discussion will explore the opportunities to be had in developing a robust public-private partnership, the obstacles that must be faced during this process, and the role research can take in informing the creation of policy.

This event, in honor of the launch of our new University Transportation Center, UC CONNECT, will be held in conjunction with Transportation Engineerings open house welcoming potential graduate students to the program and to the UC Berkeley campus. Faculty, students, new students, and alumni are welcome to join us for this event. A reception will follow.

Robust performance and rapid recovery of infrastructure systems in the immediate aftermath of a major hazard are crucial for mitigating losses and assuring well‐being of communities. Infrastructures, such as transportation and communication networks and power, water and gas distribution systems, are especially vulnerable to natural and man‐made hazards due to their spatially distributed exposure, interdependence between components, and multiplicity of failure modes. In this lecture, I will use the Bayesian network methodology to model the hazard and the infrastructure system and to process information gained from sensors, and I will use influence diagrams to make decisions on operational levels of system components and to prioritize component inspections. An application to a hypothetical model of the California high‐speed rail system in the aftermath of an earthquake in the Bay Area will demonstrate the main ideas of the approach.

California is experiencing its worst drought in recorded history, but droughts are not new to California. Over the past 150 years, during which Californias water infrastructure and its expectations for water supply developed, may have actually been a wet anomaly in Californias deeper history of aridity. Adding climate change-induced variability, drought will be part of the new normal for California. Join us for panel discussions speakers discussing the state of the drought and how to address these issues.

Solar energy represents a renewable source that has the potential to meet our ever-increasing energy demand without devastating the environment. One approach to harvesting the energy is to carry out light-powered chemical reactions. Thermodynamically uphill, these reactions produce energetic chemicals that can be used as fuels, promising a large-scale energy storage solution.
To enable these reactions, we need materials that can absorb light, separate charges, and catalyze specific chemistries. The materials should be made of earth-abundant elements to allow for large-scale implementations. They also need to be resistant against photo corrosion. To date, a low-cost, long-lasting material that can produce solar fuels with a high efficiency remains elusive.
In this talk, we present our efforts aimed at understanding what limits the performance of materials in solar fuel generation reactions. Within the context of photoanode and photocathode, we show how the photoelectrode properties are changed by introducing material components designed for improving charge transport, surface potential accumulation, and interface kinetics, respectively. We also demonstrate that highly complex organic molecules can be produced by photoreduction of CO2, in a fashion closely mimicking the dark reactions in natural photosynthesis.
This body of work is enabled by our ability to synthesize materials with precisely controlled surfaces and interfaces using methods such as atomic layer deposition. Our results highlight the importance of understanding thermodynamic and kinetic factors in complex systems such as that for solar fuel production separately. Detailed knowledge generated by our research contributes to the goal of realizing low-cost, high-efficiency artificial photosynthesis.

 Commissioner,

 California Public Utilities Commission
California energy policy supports an ambitious transition from conventional fossil generation to renewable and other clean resources. Low-carbon, variable and distributed generation provide many benefits to the state, but also present new circumstances for our traditional energy integration and reliability tools to respond to. Some of the resources that California is pursuing to manage this ramp are demand response, generation diversity, fast response natural gas plants, and energy storage.
This talk will discuss the tools and analytics the California Public Utilities Commission and the state are pursing to address integration and promote flexible resources. In particular, recent developments in energy storage and demand response, and the potential role for electric vehicles to provide these services, will be highlighted.

Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in computer
science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will likely lead to a
new wave of technological innovations in communication, computation and cryptography.
As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally stochastic, randomness and
uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum computation, quantum simulation and quantum
information. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum computation and
quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to revolutionize computational statistics. 
This talk will give a brief review on quantum computation, introduce quantum tomography and 
compressed sensing and present my recent work on their statistical connections.

We are constantly adding new functions to gadgets and new devices to the ecosystem without much thought as to their totality or cumulative complexity. In the coming era of ubiquitous sensors and miniaturized mobile computing, designers need to think about how to weave the digital world into our lives at work so seamlessly that we dont even notice. Already were seeing a groundswell of new technologies that insinuate themselves seamlessly into users personal lives like the voice and gesture-controlled Xbox, but this is just the beginning. At GE, we want to apply the same embedded intelligence to the world of big iron and people at work to create disruptive experiences, not just products or interfaces, by connecting people with people and people with machines and data. In this talk you will learn how GE Global Research is pursuing new opportunities in analytics visualization, the future of field engineering, wearables, robotics, semiautonomous vehicles, and agents that can be applied to the industrial Internet.

							Lund University, Sweden",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The scientific field of (compound) semiconductor nanowires got started seriously in the US and in Europe about 15 years ago, some ten years after the original break-through research conducted by Dr. Kenji Hiruma and his team at Hitachi in Japan.

Our own early work was initially very much exploratory research, testing to what extent we could understand, control and have fun with the ways in which nanowires nucleate and grow. The whole field of nanowires saw great progress in the use of nanowires for physics and for fairly simple model devices. Just in the last five, or so, years we have seen serious break-through in novel growth methods and the understanding of nanowire growth, as well as in the development of new technologies enabling efficient fabrication of nanowires for areas like solar cells and light-emitting diodes.
In this talk I will cover all these areas, with an emphasis on recent progress in controlled and efficient fabrication of nanowires for energy applications.

What are the challenges for deployment of telehealth in the future? This lecture will focus on giving an overview of the evidence base of telehealth within the last 20 years. What can we learn from recent studies and implementation of telehealth at scale? Telehealth has been predicted to be a quick and easy success to solve the challenges of health care for everyone and everywhere. However, for the last years studies on telehealth in Europe and the US have not lived up to the predicted expectations. The question is what are the barriers and facilitators in the past and what can we learn from them?
Birthe Dinesen has performed research within telehealth since 2001. She is focusing on patients perspective using telehealth and how to organize telehealth the best way in the healthcare sector. She is participating in national and international telehealth studies in Europe, China, USA and Australia.

Developing Quantum Dot Solids for Thin-Film Photovoltaics: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-05-02T22:00:00+00:00,2014-05-02T23:00:00+00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,,Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"Speaker/Performer: Prof. Matt Law,

Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are attractive building blocks for solar photovoltaics (PV). In this talk, I will provide an overview our ongoing efforts to design lead salt QD thin film absorbers for next-generation PV.
Basic requirements for QD absorber layers include efficient light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, and long-term stability. I will first discuss several methods used to make conductive QD films by solution deposition and ligand exchange. Studies of carrier mobility as a function of basic film parameters such as inter-QD spacing, QD size, and QD size distribution have led to a better understanding of charge transport within highly disordered QD films. Efforts to improve carrier mobility by enhancing inter-dot electronic coupling, passivating surface states, and implementing rudimentary doping will be highlighted.
Engineering the inter-QD matrix to produce QD/inorganic or QD/organic nanocomposites is introduced as a promising way to optimize coupling, remove surface states, and achieve long-term environmental stability for high-performance, robust QD films. To obtain large photocurrent from QD solar cells, it is critical to increase the minority carrier diffusion length to rival the optical absorption length, possibly by harnessing band-like transport through extended electronic states. The relative roles of superlattice order, energy disorder, and surface states in this regard will be summarized.
The talk will conclude with comments on the prospects for controlled doping and rational p-n junction formation in QD systems.

Simons Institute Open Lecture: Why are Many-body Problems in Physics so Difficult? A Quantum Information Perspective,Lecture,2014-05-13T00:00:00+00:00,2014-05-13T01:00:00+00:00,"Sutardja Dai Hall, Banatao Auditorium",Ignacio Cirac,Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing,"Determining the physical behavior of systems composed of several particles is, in general, very hard. The reason is that the number of possible combinations of states increases exponentially with the number of particles. For quantum systems the situation is even worse, since it is even very hard to specify the states in thermal equilibrium. This is due to the presence of a very intriguing property, called entanglement. In this talk I will explain this phenomenon in detail and will review several approaches to assessing this difficulty and to overcoming it under certain conditions. Some of the ideas for achieving this goal come from the field of quantum information, where experience with building powerful (so-called) quantum computers can shed new light on some of these classical and quantum problems.

Advances in drone aircraft, networked cameras, and recent disclosures about the NSAs international and domestic surveillance activities have stimulated public protests, outrage from activists, and new policy discussions among elected leaders. This symposium will highlight emerging perspectives on visual privacy and consider the state of the art from a variety of disciplines and professions, including technology, journalism, filmmaking and the arts.

Though traditionally considered separate domains, visual and digital surveillance practices are being combined as machine vision, facial recognition and other technologies become more sophisticated and interoperable. Institutional surveillance by semi-autonomous drones and remote cameras, citizen video monitoring, and incessant photo-sharing and tagging on social networks enable perpetual documentation. The same tools can be used for both transparency and repression.

This symposium will bring together scholars and practitioners from a range of disciplines to discuss privacy protections, surveillance methods, and modes of resistance in a digital age. The program will feature two keynote addresses and two panel discussions that will explore emerging surveillance technologies and applications across a range of contexts, and then turn to resistant strategies employed by individuals and organizations in response.

Since the early 1980s, the city of Berlin has developed a variety of participatory instruments that allow for civic participation in urban planning and decision-making and for the negotiation of conflicts over the use of urban space. These instruments give residents many opportunities to actively engage in local politics and contribute to the democratization of urban politics in Berlin: most recently, for example, concerning the remunicipalization of the city's electricity grid and the future use of the (now closed) inner-city airport Tempelhof. At the same time, participatory dynamics have highly ambivalent effects on urban politics from below, not least as they historically emerged as a top-down response to urban claims made by grassroots groups such as the squatter movements of the 1980s and 1990s. The talk offers a brief tour through the recent history of participatory politics in Berlin. Drawing from case-studies in Berlin and other cities, it will then focus on the contradictory relationship between urban social movements and participatory politics and point out some questions and research perspectives that emerge from these observations.

The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), adopted by U.N. in 2006, has brought disability rights into the global agenda. U.S.A. and Japan have been taking different paths to the implementation and ratification of the CRPD. While Japan ratified the CRPD in January 2014 after the passage of the Act on Elimination of Disability Discrimination in June 2013, the CRPD ratification remains a political issue in U.S.A, which has a number of civil rights achievements, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.
This open forum, organized by Center for Japanese Studies (UCB), Center for Global Studies (University of Shizuoka), Research Center for Ars Vivendi (Ritsumeikan University) and IRIS, has three distinguished speakers from Japan and U.S.
Professor Ishikawa Jun of University of Shizuoka will discuss the overall harmonization efforts of Japan towards the implementation of the CRPD, giving particular attention to information accessibility. In addition to being the chair of Disability Policy Committee of the government of Japan, Dr. Ishikawa is a developer of Assistive technologies for blind users and used to chair a non-profit organization working for information accessibility for the blind.

Professor Peter Blanck, University Professor & Chairman of the Burton Blatt Institute at Syracuse University, will talk about U.S. and transnational disability policy and law in regard to Web accessibility for persons across the spectrum of disability. Dr. Blancks forthcoming book, entitled eQuality: The Struggle for Access to the Web (Cambridge Press, 2014), examines the future of Web Equality under the ADA, the CRPD and other states domestic laws.
Jim Fruchterman, social entrepreneur, is founder and CEO of Benetech, a non-profit organization, serving over 250,000 people with print disabilities, will share his insights on information technology and policy development. He has participated in three U.S. federal advisory committees on disability issues, as well as having actively participated in the drafting and negotiations for the Treaty of Marrakesh benefiting people who are blind or print disabled, which was signed by 51 countries in June 2013.

In this panel, we explore the frontiers of open access regimes within the food system, using seeds and land as starting points from which to reassess resource ownership and property rights in agriculture. We also consider how open access regimes connect to food sovereignty  the rights of local people to define their own food systems. In recent years, open-source licensing has emerged as a new approach to protect the seed innovations of farmers and plant breeders and provide them with access to diversified germplasm. Like open-source software, open-source seeds would create a protected commons in which materials are freely available and widely exchanged, but are protected from appropriation by monopoly interests. Similarly, land has become the focus of redoubled efforts to facilitate open access to resources for food production  the Landless Workers Movement in Brazil is one prominent example. We ask: what are the ways in which managing access to agricultural resources  whether plant genes or land can promote the common good, and how might these ways change in different cultural and political contexts?

 Associate Professor, Human and Community Development, UC Davis
In this panel, we will consider the multifaceted links between labor and health. We will examine this relationship in a number of ways, including impacts of poor labor conditions on the health of consumers and implications for food safety, as well as the impacts on workers across the food chain themselves. From migrant farmworkers to meat processing plants to restaurant workers, labor issues are integrally linked with health at every step of our food chain. Our food system is the largest industry employing Americans, and yet, provides the lowest paying jobs. These workers who grow, process, and serve our food often dont have the means to get their own, or to stay healthy. A healthy food chain, thus, is not just one where safe food reaches consumers, but one in which all of the workers along the way are also treated fairly, with proper wages, mandatory sick days, and ample opportunity to lead healthy lives. What are the economic obstacles standing in the way of this goal? What are the regulatory frameworks and policy levers working to address these intertwined issues of labor and health in our food system and how can they be improved to better support our economy as well as public health?

California is experiencing its worst drought in recorded history, but droughts are not new to California. Over the past 150 years, during which Californias water infrastructure and its expectations for water supply developed, may have actually been a wet anomaly in Californias deeper history of aridity. Adding climate change-induced variability, drought will be part of the new normal for California. Join us for panel discussions speakers discussing the state of the drought and how to address these issues.

 California Public Utilities Commission
California energy policy supports an ambitious transition from conventional fossil generation to renewable and other clean resources. Low-carbon, variable and distributed generation provide many benefits to the state, but also present new circumstances for our traditional energy integration and reliability tools to respond to. Some of the resources that California is pursuing to manage this ramp are demand response, generation diversity, fast response natural gas plants, and energy storage.
This talk will discuss the tools and analytics the California Public Utilities Commission and the state are pursing to address integration and promote flexible resources. In particular, recent developments in energy storage and demand response, and the potential role for electric vehicles to provide these services, will be highlighted.

Dean of the Arts and Humanities Anthony Cascardi and the Arts Research Center are honored to welcome artist, sculptor, and UC Berkeley alumnus Bruce Beasley back to campus. Beasley, whose momentous career has spanned over 55 years working in California and the Bay Area, will present his work and thoughts on the artistic process in a public lecture on March 7, 2014.

Born in Los Angles in 1939, Bruce Beasley is recognized as one of the most noteworthy and innovative sculptors on the West Coast. He began his art studies at Dartmouth College before transferring to the UC Berkeley art department in 1959. Beasley has traveled to Japan, Mexico, China, Hong Kong, Germany, Alaska, and Spain to lecture and attend exhibits and installations of his work. A self-described unrepentant modernist, Bruce Beasley advanced the idea of sculpture with formal structures that could be simultaneously observed in multiple views. Never static, Beasley continues to work from his West Oakland compound, using new materials and new technologies.

"Looking South: Re/Introducing Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierras Historia geográfica, civil y natural de la Isla de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico (1782, 1866)",Lecture,2014-03-14T20:10:00+00:00,2014-03-14T22:00:00+00:00,5125 Dwinelle Hall,,Department of Spanish & Portuguese,"Speaker/Performer: Santa Arias,

 University of Kansas
Colonial historiography and geographical representations of the island San Juan de Puerto Rico encapsulate the islands shifting geopolitical position in the Caribbean. This presentation examines European geopolitics, Spanish Bourbon reforms, and their ties to the genre of geo-histories in an examination of Agustín Íñigo Abbad y Lasierras Historia geográfica, civil y natural de la Isla de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico (1782). The Benedictine friar and imperial Enlightenment thinker, Abbad y Lasierra, provided his own critique of the hierarchy of colonial regions as he assessed personally the southern Caribbean. The essay argues that Abbad y Lasierras writing and geopolitical thinking is part of a long-standing, Iberian-bounded military and ecclesiastical project reasserting political power looking south toward the Lesser Antillean archipelago and northeastern South American coast.

"ATC Lecture - Stephanie Syjuco ""Lossy: On the Politics of Networked Flows and Degraded Systems""",Lecture,2014-04-01T03:30:00+00:00,2014-04-01T05:00:00+00:00,"Sutardja Dai Hall, 310 Banatao Auditorium","Stephanie Syjuco,
							Assistant Professor in Sculpture and Ceramic Sculpture,

							UC Berkeley",Center for New Media,"Traditionally used to refer to the degradation of an image when compressed as a digital JPG file, lossy is a state in which digital information is discarded for the sake of file size. Resolution is lost, detail is changed and fineness is compromised. In this process, however, extra pixels may also be added, ultimately transforming and re-authoring the resulting Doppelgänger image. Long interested in issues of analog-to-digital mistranslations, public access, and flows of information and capital, visual artist Stephanie Syjuco will present recent projects exploring the murky territory of the physicality of objects in relationship to virtual space, ""resolution"" as a metaphor for craft, and authorship in an era of co-authored or crowdsourced information. By flipping the loss of original resolution from being a negative condition into a potentially generative one, her works scrutinize how active transformation occurs through misuse and degradation. Perhaps this new, bastard un-original has much more to say by way of poetic narrative, speculative fiction and alternative readings than its static predecessor ever did. Syjuco will also introduce several ongoing projects utilizing online networks such as Facebook, Ebay, Google searches, and Craigslist to explore how the cannibalization of what appear to be limited structures of use and interaction can be leveraged towards critique.

Syjuco is a visual artist and educator who utilizes physical surrogates, counterfeits and digital networks to address the political and social implications of economies and labor in an era of late capitalism. She has participated in numerous exhibitions including at: MoMA/P.S.1, the Whitney Museum of American Art, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Frieze Projects (London), ZKM Center for Art and Technology (Germany), Z33 Space for Contemporary Art (Belgium), Universal Studios Gallery (Beijing) and Garanti Gallery (Istanbul), among others. She is currently collaborating with the FLACC Workplace for Visual Artists in Genk, Belgium, on a new body of work utilizing 3-D scanning of Belgian and Congolese antiquities to produce hybrid objects addressing the legacy of colonialism, empire, and trade routes. She is an Assistant Professor in Sculpture and Ceramic Sculpture at UC Berkeley.

In this talk, we propose a general framework for topic-specific summarization of large text corpora and illustrate how it can be used for the analysis of document collections. Our framework, concise comparative summarization
(CCS), is built on sparse classification methods. It is a lightweight and flexible tool that offers a compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently in wide use and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We argue that sparse methods have much to offer for text analysis and hope CCS opens the door for a new branch of research in this important field.
Using news articles from the New York Times, we validate our tool by designing and conducting a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human understanding. We demonstrate our approach with two case studies, a media analysis of the framing of Egypt in the New York Times throughout the Arab Spring and an informal comparison of the New York Times and Wall Street Journals coverage of energy.

Overall, we find that the Lasso with L2 normalization can be effectively and usefully used to summarize large corpora, regardless of document size. Finally, I will present preliminary results in an on-going project to study the opinions of U.S. courts of appeal by using CCS in combination with LDA.

"Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans from the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo, 1923",Film - Documentary,2014-03-04T00:00:00+00:00,2014-03-04T01:00:00+00:00,"Institute of East Asian Studies (2223 Fulton, 6th Floor)","Jinhee Lee,
							Associate Professor of History,

							Eastern Illinois University",Center for Korean Studies (CKS),"In 1923, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake shook Tokyo and Yokohoma, essentially leveling Japans two largest cities and causing more than 100,000 deaths. The subsequent aftershocks, fires, and ensuing panic bred rumors that malcontent Koreans living in Japan were setting the fires, poisoning water wells, and plotting a revolution. To prevent this alleged uprising, vigilantes along with police and the military massacred more than 6,000 Koreans.

Partly to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the massacre, two unreleased rare documentaries from Japan have been touring the United States since last September. The films feature interviews with Japanese and Korean survivors, and the first of the two sequel films ""Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans From the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo, 1923 will be shown. The movie was directed by Choonkong Oh, a Korean resident of Japan, and is in Japanese and Korean with English subtitles.

The documentary is under an hour long, and will be followed by a discussion featuring Jinhee Lee, a history professor at Eastern Illinois University whose research focuses on the competing narratives of collective violence in the Japanese empire.

This presentation aims to shed light on the abruptness of the Soviet economic collapse. It focuses on the return of economic nationalism to the Union republics, and the role that played in cutting trade links and consequently production.

A panel of LGBTQ students will talk about their experiences of ""coming out"" and ""letting in"" (more on those two concepts below).

As a part of The Hook Up, a health-focused series of events cosponsored by Tang and GenEq, this panel allows students to learn from one another, because navigating the terrains of ""coming out"" and ""letting in"" can be confusing, exhausting, or sometimes just annoying. Come to get ideas, to share stories, to see yourself reflected in others, to support your communities, or for the free (healthy) snacks!

""Coming out"" is never a one-time process. We both meet new people, and sometimes we're prompted to circle back to the same people as our understandings of ourselves flows and shifts. In addition to a type of exporting our understandings of ourselves through a ""coming out"" process to others, ""letting in"" as a concept allows us to invite others into our understandings of self.
""A colleague suggests that we reframe 'coming out' as 'letting in,' as in letting others into our lives. He reasons that 'letting in' better manages fluidity and the people we (surprisingly) love. The 'letting in' frame allows for agency over what to disclose, to whom and when -- in gradations -- without assuming a fixed identity or that a private life conflicts with a public persona. If coming out is a confession, then letting in is a communion. We share our life stories, not just our secrets."" - Robert Espinoza

Advances in drone aircraft, networked cameras, and recent disclosures about the NSAs international and domestic surveillance activities have stimulated public protests, outrage from activists, and new policy discussions among elected leaders. This symposium will highlight emerging perspectives on visual privacy and consider the state of the art from a variety of disciplines and professions, including technology, journalism, filmmaking and the arts.

Though traditionally considered separate domains, visual and digital surveillance practices are being combined as machine vision, facial recognition and other technologies become more sophisticated and interoperable. Institutional surveillance by semi-autonomous drones and remote cameras, citizen video monitoring, and incessant photo-sharing and tagging on social networks enable perpetual documentation. The same tools can be used for both transparency and repression.

This symposium will bring together scholars and practitioners from a range of disciplines to discuss privacy protections, surveillance methods, and modes of resistance in a digital age. The program will feature two keynote addresses and two panel discussions that will explore emerging surveillance technologies and applications across a range of contexts, and then turn to resistant strategies employed by individuals and organizations in response.

Panel 1) Opportunities and Challenges of Reunification: Politics after the Purge 
Moderator: Thomas Gold, UC Berkeley

What is the direction of North Koreas domestic politics after the purge, and what are the implications for its relations in Northeast Asia and with the United States? How do we create an accurate model for factional struggles, bureaucratic competition, and other issues under the framework of one‐man rule, and how can looking back at Chinese politics in the Mao era provide insights into the opportunities and challenges of reunification?
Panel 2) Inside Kim Jong Uns North Korea: Society and Economy 
Moderator: Orville Schell, Asia Society of New York
What are the significant recent changes in North Korean society, and what are the implications for opening and reform, stability, and improvement in human rights? What roles might non‐governmental organizations and media play in deepening outsiders understanding of the situation inside North Korea?
Panel 3) U.S. and its Allies: Roles for Reunification 
Moderator: John Delury, Yonsei University

How will the U.S. pivot to Asia influence relations among America and its allies, and their relations with China, in regards to North Korea, particularly on the nuclear issue? How do the U.S., South Korea, and others maintain policy coordination while at the same time taking proactive steps? What policy lessons can be learned from the experience of U.S.‐China relations and applied to the case of North Korea?

							Visiting Scholar,

							Middle East Program, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace","Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ISEEES)","After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergence of new independent states in the Caucasus and Central Asia, Turkey had to reorganize its regional political and strategic vision, giving this region a central role in its foreign policy. Ankaras main objective was to transform this region into a Turkish sphere of influence. However, the ambitious and political dimension of this vision for Central Asia and the Caucasus has gradually been abandoned. A more realistic and balanced policy has been adopted, giving priority to cultural, economic, and religious cooperation. Realizing that these countries were very sensitive to their new independence and sovereignty, Turkey has started to privilege bilateral relations with each country rather than adopting a global and integrationist approach. The goal of this lecture is to develop the main outreaches of Turkish policy in this region, mainly in the sphere of cultural, educational, and religious cooperation  areas where an incontestable Turkish soft power is currently in development.

"Screening of ""Campaign 2"" and Q&A with filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda",Film - Documentary,2014-03-12T02:00:00+00:00,2014-03-12T05:30:00+00:00,"Sutardja Dai Hall, 310 Banatao Auditorium","Kazuhiro Soda,
							Filmmaker",Center for Japanese Studies (CJS),"In response to the Fukushima disaster, Yama-san is running an election campaign with an anti-nuclear message. But unlike last time, he has no money, no machine, no nothing.

In his previous 2005 by-election depicted in ""Campaign"", Kazuhiko ""Yama-san"" Yamauchi was the official candidate of the LDP, headed by then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. He won the vacant seat, fully backed by the LDP's political machine. However, for the election in 2007, the LDP did not endorse Yama-san, and backed a different candidate. For the past 4 years, Yama-san has stayed away from politics, living as a ""house husband"" to raise his newborn son Yuki.

So, this election in 2011 is a come-back attempt by Yama-san after 4 quiet years. But the situation is not so forgiving. The total budget for his campaign is now only 84,720 Japanese Yen (about $850)  all for printing posters and postcards.

Does he even stand a chance?

Filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda debuted with ""Campaign"" in 2007 at the Berlinale, and has been winning international awards with his observational film series such as ""Mental"" (2008), ""Peace"" (2010), and ""Theatre 1 & 2"" (2012). ""Campaign 2"" candidly captures the mechanical lives of the Japanese people, firmly adhered to even in the midst of a disaster where radioactive material is falling from the sky. Soda's camera, which had maintained an outsider's position in ""Campaign, gradually gets ensnared in the situation. Conflict between the filmmaker and the subjects eventually escalates and finally comes to a head.

The goal of the Baxter Liberty Initiative at the University of California, Berkeley is to encourage dialogue on the ideal of freedom in political and economic life. The central place of the idea of liberty in the founding and development of the American nation and the tensions between liberty and other values are of enduring moral and political significance. There are sharp disagreements about the consequences of economic and political institutions where freedom and choice are the constitutive features, and the purpose of the Baxter Liberty Initiative is to engage the Berkeley campus with these ideas through the intellectual contributions of distinguished scholars whose own work has illuminated the role of liberty in specific phases of social life and public policy.

The Rule of Law and the Unruliness of Religion: Reflections on Legal Multiculturalism,Lecture,2014-03-13T01:00:00+00:00,2014-03-13T03:00:00+00:00,3335 Dwinelle Hall,"Benjamin Berger,
							Associate Professor,

							York University",Berkeley Center for the Study of Religion,"In a recent work on the nature of religious speech, sociologist Bruno Latour cautioned that the more you make religion modern and acceptable, soft and digestible, the less you are faithful to its specific order of difficulty. This talk aims to draw out that specific order of difficulty, exploring the way in which the prevailing story about laws role in the management of religious difference obscures the features that make religion a distinctively unruly phenomenon within a modern culture of laws rule, and hides the paradoxes and awkwardness into which religion leads the constitutional rule of law. In exposing these features of the interaction of modern law and religion, the talk will touch on issues such as the way in which religion is transformed by laws gaze, the strange relationship of law to choice and freedom in its treatment of religion, and the troubled life of legal toleration. Drawing on the experience of religious diversity and the law in Canada, where the rhetoric of legal multiculturalism has been particularly powerful, the talk seeks to set the stage for a better account of the interaction of law and religion in any liberal constitutional order.

Benjamin L. Berger is an Associate Professor at Osgoode Hall Law School at York University in Toronto and is a member of the faculty of Yorks Graduate Program in Socio-Legal Studies. His research and teaching focuses on the interplay between religious difference and the culture of laws rule; the social functions of criminal and constitutional law; and the nature, quality, and virtues of legal judgment. Prior to joining Osgoode, Professor Berger was an associate professor in the Faculty of Law and held a cross appointment in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Victoria, where he began teaching in 2004. He served as law clerk to the Rt. Honourable Beverley McLachlin, Chief Justice of Canada, and was a Fulbright Scholar at Yale University, where he earned his LL.M. and J.S.D.

Since the early 1980s, the city of Berlin has developed a variety of participatory instruments that allow for civic participation in urban planning and decision-making and for the negotiation of conflicts over the use of urban space. These instruments give residents many opportunities to actively engage in local politics and contribute to the democratization of urban politics in Berlin: most recently, for example, concerning the remunicipalization of the city's electricity grid and the future use of the (now closed) inner-city airport Tempelhof. At the same time, participatory dynamics have highly ambivalent effects on urban politics from below, not least as they historically emerged as a top-down response to urban claims made by grassroots groups such as the squatter movements of the 1980s and 1990s. The talk offers a brief tour through the recent history of participatory politics in Berlin. Drawing from case-studies in Berlin and other cities, it will then focus on the contradictory relationship between urban social movements and participatory politics and point out some questions and research perspectives that emerge from these observations.

The dramatic uprising in Ukraine that culminated in the flight and impeachment of then President Viktor Yanukovich and the instauration of an interim Ukrainian government has brought a long simmering dispute between Russia on the one hand and the United States and its NATO and EU allies over Ukraines external orientation to a head. What was initially a dramatic domestic crisis has become the most dangerous geopolitical confrontation since the end of the Cold War. The panel, organized by the Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies, will address domestic politics and internal cleavages within Ukraine, Ukraines economic prospects, Russias interests and objectives, and the policy options for the US and its Western allies.

Models based on potential outcomes, also known as counterfactuals, were introduced by Neyman (1923) and later applied to observational contexts by Rubin (1974). Such models are now used extensively within Biostatistics, Statistics, Political Science, Economics, and Epidemiology for reasoning about causation. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), introduced by Wright (1921) are another formalism used to represent causal systems. Graphs are also extensively used in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Sociology and Epidemiology.

In this talk, I will present a simple approach to unifying these two frameworks via a new graph, termed the Single-World Intervention Graph (SWIG). The SWIG encodes the counterfactual independencies associated with a specific hypothetical intervention on a set of treatment variables. The nodes on the SWIG are the corresponding counterfactual random variables. The SWIG is derived from a causal DAG via a simple node splitting transformation. I will illustrate the theory with a number of examples. Finally I show that SWIGs avoid a number of pitfalls that are present in an alternative approach to unification, based on twin networks that has been advocated by Pearl (2000).

It may seem bizarre to talk of expanding networks of cooperation in East Asia at a time when Japanese Prime Minister Abe is telling the Davos World Forum that relations between China and Japan are analogous to those between Britain and Germany in 1914the outbreak of World War I. Certainly, in recent years, unresolved and increasingly tense maritime; expanding defense budgets; contrasting historical memories; and the American repositioning in East Asia are but a few of the headline grabbers suggesting that East Asia is ripe for rivalry.
Yet, financial, trade and regional production linkages across East Asia have never been deeper, nor expanding more quickly. Equally, formal regional organizations such as the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN plus Three, are exploding in number and influence.

This talk will examaine this apparent disjuncture. Much of the explanation, Pempel will argue, lies in how countries answer the question who is my enemy? In Northeast Asia particularly, on issues of hard security and military matters, the leaders of China, Japan and both Koreas uniformly point fingers are one another. That is far less true in Southeast Asia. And on matters of finance and economics, most East Asian leaders are less skeptical of one another and more likely to identify external finance and bodies such as the International Monetary Fund as their largest threat, leading them to greater cooperation with one another.

The Amerikan Steppes: The Great Plains in a Russian Mirror,Lecture,2014-03-19T00:00:00+00:00,2014-03-19T01:30:00+00:00,270 Stephens Hall,"David Moon,
							Anniversary Professor of History,

							The University of York","Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ISEEES)","This paper  based on my new book project - explores connections between the steppes and the Great Plains. The two regions share similar environments  both are semi-arid grasslands  and environmental histories  on both, indigenous populations who lived mobile lifestyles based on livestock (Plains Indians and steppe nomads) were displaced by farmers of European origins or backgrounds who ploughed up the fertile soil to grow crops. This process started first on the steppes.

Between the mid-C19th and mid-C20th, there were a series of transfers between the two grasslands. The extent to which Russian and Soviet steppe farming drew on American machinery and also organization is well known.
Not quite as well known, and especially not in their entirety, are the transfers the other way, from the steppes to the Great Plains:

 Migration by Mennonites and Volga Germans.

 The introduction of drought- and disease-resistant varieties of wheat, most famously Turkey Red, and also other crops.

 The adoption by the US Soil Survey of a methodology based on Russian genetic soil science. The Russian approach was devised on the basis of field work in the black-region of the forest-steppe and steppe in the late C19; American soil scientists tested it on the Great Plains.
 The Prairie States Forestry Project  the planting of shelterbelts on the Great Plains in the 1930s  was based on Russian steppe forestry and masterminded by a Russian-born American forester  Raphael Zon.

 The most lasting legacy of the connections between the steppes and Great Plains may well be the tumbleweed. Now and icon of the American West, seeds of perekati pole were imported accidentally in a sack of flax seed by Mennonite migrants to the Dakotas in the late-C19 and then spread rapidly and destructively across the West.

The Trials of Muhammad Ali covers the most explosive crossroads of Alis life. When Cassius Clay became Muhammad Ali, his conversion to Islam and refusal to serve in the Vietnam War left him banned from boxing and facing a five-year prison sentence. When Ali chose faith and conscience over fame and fortune, it resonates far beyond the boxing ring, striking issues of race, faith and identity that continue to confront us all today.

Immigrant detention is, today, the single-largest dimension of human confinement operated by the U.S. Federal government. Yet immigrant detention is often forgotten as a pillar of the nation's carceral regime. This strange omission is rooted in a decision made one century ago by the United States Supreme Court, which determined that human confinement in the pursuit of deportation is ""not imprisonment in a legal sense."" This paper excavates the origins of immigrant detention as a practice of human confinement that operates, in a legal sense, separate and apart from imprisonment but everyday fills the nation's jails, prisons, and detention facilities.

Mass incarceration in the United States is the largest, most lucrative, most racialized, and most destructive social experiment in recent history. Only the men and women who live behind bars are fully invested in the truth, are willing and able to bear witness to the state of our prisons, and are subjects of sufficient public fascination to be heard by a broad public.

This talk will present Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America, a collection of 71 essays from writers incarcerated in 27 American states. Fourth City is the largest collection to date of first-person witness to how the American prison is experienced by those living inside it. Fourth City presents the prison population as it sees itself: not as a regrettable abstraction or liability of the neoliberal state, but as an extant community of 2.26 million living under hostile supervision, and for this reason experiencing a life more cohesive, across an archipelago of facilities, than that experienced by residents of New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago. Fourth City presents incarcerated Americans as a national constituency, and as the constituency best positioned to witness what is wrong with current prison practice in the U.S., its real effects on its wards, and how the prison in America fails the mission of correction so badly. The talk will also discuss a Digital Humanities project now in progress, The American Prison Writing Archive. The APWA is planned as an open-source, digital archive of non-fiction, American prison writing, including the work of incarcerated people, prison staff, administrators, and volunteers. Fourth City and the APWA are efforts to relocate those directly affected by the prison complex from the periphery to the center of the conversation about mass incarceration in the U.S. today.

How to Think the Knowing Subject Anew? The Concept of the Distributed Center Subject: Its Philosophical and Practical Applications

In following the moderns in the making of scientific knowledge, STS scholars have shown an interesting discrepancy between what scientists do in practice and what they say they do in theory. Indeed, scientific objectivity has been entirely reconfigured and reinterpreted in very different ways. In continuity with this endeavor, and because the definition of the object goes hand in hand with the definition of the subject, one of my obsessions has been to re-interrogate the definition of the knowing subject. If another definition of scientific objectivity emerges, and if science is socially or collectively and materially madedepending on our conception of the socialwhat does this do to our classical notion of the knowing subject? What does it do to the most powerful and operative myth of the modern: the disincorporated brain? And by extension, what does it do to our notions of the person, the individual genius, the rational actor, the psyche, and or subjectivity, to which this myth is anchored?

Believing in the strength of doing empirical philosophy, Stephen Hawking struck me as a beautiful empirical case: in part because he is the incarnation of one of the most powerful myths of the modernsthe brain in a vatand in part because (or as a consequence) he is a counter example that pushes the boundaries of what STS has taught us. Following the traces of his presence I have reconstructed the mediations that make a knowing subject. Through this research I have developed the concept of the distributed centered subject. I will discuss the philosophical and practical implications of such a concept.

A PhD-trained scholar and writer with degrees from the Sorbonne and the Centre de Sociologie de lInnovation de lEcole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris, Hélène Mialets research interests are in continental philosophy, science and technology studies, and social theory. She has held post-docs at Oxford and Cambridge Universities and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, and positions at Cornell, Berkeley, and Harvard. She is most recently the author of Hawking Incorporated (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), an ethnographic study of abstraction and formalism, focusing on the case of Stephen Hawking as a means of exploring larger questions about singularity, identity, distributed agency, subjectivity, corporeality and socio-technical networks.

In the series following-up from last Falls Forms of Survival and the Politics of Vulnerability, Politics Beyond the Human continues to address notions of survival and how survival can act as a license to force and at other times a basis for resistance, while expanding the scope of inquiry to include discussions of the nonhuman world. The workshop is developed and led by Michelle Ty (PhD candidate English, Designated Emphasis Critical Theory).

Japanese Village Studies: Occupation-Era Anthropology and the Problem of Modernity,Colloquium,2014-04-11T00:00:00+00:00,2014-04-11T01:00:00+00:00,"Institute of East Asian Studies (2223 Fulton, 6th Floor)","Amy Borovoy,

							Princeton University",Center for Japanese Studies (CJS),"World War II flooded American universities with government and foundation funds for area studies. The war had served as a wake-up call to American parochialism; there was a pervasive sense that universities, mired in euro-centrism, had failed the U.S. government with a dearth of knowledge about world cultures and languages (Hall 1949: iii; Campbell 5-7). The Cold War created a strong imperative to support economic growth throughout the newly decolonized, developing world. American foundations and research councils committed themselves to in-depth study of specific areas and languages in American higher education.
In part because of the American occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1952, Japan was imagined as a real-world laboratory for studying the process of modernization. In this paper I explore American occupation-era village studies as a moment in which social scientists, in the immediate aftermath of the war, were confronting difficult on-the-ground questions about what modern institutions might look like. These local villages were meant to serve as laboratories for studying the process of democratization and modernization. In practice, however, the studies offered a somewhat more complex take on the processes of modernization.
Japanese village and kinship organizations were integral to supporting the authoritarian social structure leading up to World War II. In coming to terms with the historical antecedents and prewar institutions that formed the foundations of postwar development, the writers emphasized the everyday functionality of practices such as shrine worship and primogenitural inheritance, divorcing these from nationalism and authoritarianism. This led to later work which saw these institutions as possible foundations for new forms of capitalism.
My focus is on the University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies Okayama Field Site, the only site through which researchers could gain access to Japan during the postwar occupation (1945-1952). This research culminated in a comprehensive volume, Village Japan (1959). Later I analyze Ezra and Suzanne Vogels 1963 ethnography, Japans New Middle Class, an early ethnography of a postwar urban community.
By the early 1970s, Japan anthropology was becoming the site of an important thought experiment: a case study of modernity in which society continued to be undergirded by traditional forms of community. Even as contemporary Japanese scholars derided feudalism as illiberal and backwards, American scholars described hierarchy, shared ideology, and kin-based paternalism as compatible with modernity, democracy, and capitalism. Interestingly, Vogels later study, Canton Under Communism, blamed the absence of a feudal regime for the failure of China to modernize in the early 20th century.

New York City has nearly six hundred miles of coastline. We turn our backs on the waters that surround us to our great peril. For many years, experts of various stripes have been warning about the threat posed to the city by climate change-induced rising tides. In 1999, for example, the Environmental Defense Fund published a report titled Hot Nights in the City: Global Warming, Sea-Level Rise, and the New York Metropolitan Region. A decade later, MoMA and P.S.1 collaborated on a design competition, Rising Tides: Projects for New Yorks Waterfront, that was intended to explore innovative solutions to the citys heightened vulnerability to storm-surge induced inundation. Yet when Hurricane Sandy struck New York just over a year ago, the city seemed almost totally unprepared for the infrastructural and human emergencies provoked by this natural disaster. Numerous factors combined to make New York vulnerable to Sandy, but underlying them all was the fact that weve largely forgotten our citys links to its maritime environment. Since the spread of mass air transport, few of us travel long distances on the surface of the planets oceans. Even fewer of us actually depend directly on the sea for our livelihoods. In the words of the filmmaker Alan Sekula, the oceans have become the worlds forgotten space, an occult zone absolutely crucial to global economic exchange and yet almost totally elided from cultural representation. This is the story of how we forgot the sea.

They attach to these ideas and beliefs, and they fight over them -- this only leads suffering. The word for that is ""ignorance"". Not only that, but through their intense desire, anger and ignorance, human beings are exterminating all life on this planet through a mindless pursuit of material comfort and temporary ease. If human beings do not soon ""wake up,"" they risk ending life for so many species of living things, not only themselves.

""Zen"" (meditation) means returning to the fundamental, true Self - which comes before nationality or religion. An American-born Zen monk and graduate of Yale and Harvard, Hyon Gak Sunim ordained as a monk in 1992. In his talk, he will stress that meditation is not based on religion, belief, or dogma. It is scientifically tested, peer-reviewed and affirmed technology for human beings to reach their innermost depths and most creative possibilities.
As we well know, recent scientific studies have proven that meditation frees up creative forces, unleashes unconscious creativities, and generates non-sectarian bases for genuine fellow-feeling and modes of compassionate interaction. The explosive field of neuroplasticity itself proves that when human beings spend even just a few minutes a day, following their breath and noticing deeply their thought-patterns, they are subtly freed from entrapping patterns of thought and feeling. This talk will introduce to the public the basic teaching of Zen, and its central technology of looking into one's true nature.

Holy Minded: American Evangelicals and Intellectual Life,Lecture,2014-04-18T01:00:00+00:00,2014-04-18T03:00:00+00:00,3335 Dwinelle Hall,,Berkeley Center for the Study of Religion,"Speaker/Performer: Molly Worthen,

Evangelicals have an authority problem. Torn between the demands of dogma, reason, and spiritual experience ever since the origins of their movement in the Reformation, evangelicals struggle  more than most people  to reconcile competing sources of intellectual authority at once. This ongoing crisis has produced a culture that observers and believers alike have called anti-intellectual. Yet evangelical defenders insist that their approach to education and critical inquiry is no more biased or blinkered than that of secular thinkers; if anything, it is more honest. An examination of how 20th-century American evangelicals have navigated the straits between religious and secular authorities in the realms of science, history, and worship suggests that this crisis is both evangelicals greatest bane and an abiding source of strength.

 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
All evangelicals say that their primary  if not sole  source of religious authority is the Bible. Yet their inability to agree on what, precisely, the Bible means tells us that evangelical engagement with this text is not uniform or simple. A host of mediating influences and authorities intervene: scriptura is never, truly, sola. In recent years, scholars of American evangelicalism have focused on this question of what is really happening when their subjects say that they simply believe the Bible.

 Associate Professor of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame
Adorno has a complex attitude toward utopian thought. On the one hand, he views as dangerous and destructive fascist and vulgar Marxist strands of utopianism and has a subtle diagnostic critique of their attractions and deficiencies. On the other hand, he views the proper use of utopian imagination to be essential for human freedom and writes copiously about the dangers of prior ideological constraint not only of the content of imagination but also of the possible forms that imagination can take, political and otherwise. This paper joins an analysis of Adornos thought on utopianism with an exposition and critique of his interpretation of Mahlers symphonic practice. I argue that Adornos discussion of Mahler both takes precedence in his thought on artistic utopianism and clarifies his treatment of the continuing salience of utopian thought in politics. (Rush)

An observation of others suffering A Study of the Disaster Writings, Thoughts and Cultural Identity of Japan-educated Chinese Writers Before and After the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake

The death toll from the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 has been estimated at nearly 130,000. After the earthquake, it was rumored that Koreans were poisoning wells. Radical Japanese activists thus sought to identify what they termed not-their-own-people, those with strange accents and pronunciation, in an attempt to find and kill Koreans. Some of the Chinese residents in the area were then mistakenly identified as Koreans and killed. The Great Kanto Earthquake as a context of discourse on the cultural relationship between China, Korea and Japan to some extent represents an imagination of a common body of East Asia, which contains many unstable elements and potential conflicts arising from differences in national identity, national character and national power.

The Great Kanto Earthquake highlighted the fact that Japan would always be threatened by its location in an earthquake-prone zone. The rise in militarism was hoped to insure that Japan would always have the option of taking over the land and resources of China. In the face of the suffering of his Japanese neighbors, 郭沫若Guo Moruo wrote to express his feelings and thoughts on natural disasters within the context of a heterogeneous culture. He began his literary career as a romanticist writer, and later redirected his literary interest to a variety of fields and creations, ranging from historical plays to studies of ancient society, translation of works on Marxism and writings of communist militarism. This project intends to explore ideas about the Great Kanto earthquake expressed by Gou and other Japanese-educated Chinese writers in order to better understand the relationship between Chinese and Japanese intellectuals in this complicated era.

Besides, While the Chinese writer Guo was described as the son of Asia by the Japanese writer Satou Haruo, Japan was seen as the greatest empire in East Asia from the Japanese perspective. The change in Guos ideas about Japan can be understood in the context of the emergence of an East Asia Discourse in the early 20th century. Japanese scholar Ito notes that both Chinese and Japanese intellectuals attempted to pursue surpassing national values in order to develop international communism, such asIn the mid-1920s, the pro-Japanese Chinese writer周作人 Zhou Zuoren learned from Saneatsu Mushanokōji the Ideal of New Villagea commune in which all people farm and read together, and help each other. That is ideal Communism society. Although their efforts repeatedly failed. The divisions and networks among many organizations, societies and groups in Europe, America and Asia can be traced back to the works produced by Chinese and Japanese writers during the period of 1920-1940.

The new bronze tablet from Phigaleia is one of the earliest ever documents of this category dating to the early Classical period (early 5th cent. BCE).

"After ""Assimilating Seoul"": Changgyŏng Garden and the Post-Colonial Remaking of Seouls Public Spaces",Colloquium,2014-05-03T00:00:00+00:00,2014-05-03T01:00:00+00:00,"Institute of East Asian Studies (2223 Fulton, 6th Floor), Conference Room","Todd A. Henry,
							Assistant Professor of History,

							UC San Diego",Center for Korean Studies (CKS),"The title of this talk is meant to signal two related topics for discussion. The first refers to my new book, ""Assimilating Seoul: Japanese Rule and The Politics of Public Space in Colonial Korea, 1910-1945"" (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2014). The introductory part of the talk reviews the central argument of that book  namely, that public space functioned as contact zones wherein varying projects of assimilation were both implanted by state officials and contested by their non-elite users. The second part of the talk extends this story beyond the liberation of 1945 and into the history of South Korea. In this context, the title refers to the project of recasting the capital city as a capitalist and anti-communist focus of post-colonial politics. After briefly examining the post-liberation strategy of erasure, the fate of Namsans Shintō Shrines, I turn to the more common strategy of decolonization, which involved creatively recycling the citys palace grounds before ultimately restoring them. To trace this decolonizing strategy, I explore the fate of Changgyŏng Garden, whose popular zoo, park, museum and other recreational facilities persisted long after 1945. Meanwhile, the early architects of South Korea creatively re-used this site for new national purposes, including to memorialize anti-communist patriots and to showcase the countrys infant industries. It was only over the next three decades that the overlapping functions of this public space were separated into distinct sites, each capable of carrying out a specific role in re-subjectifying the citizenry.

You will have the unforgettable chance to experience the incredible sound of this remarkable ensemble, directed by three of the classical music world's podium greats.
One orchestra, three master conductors. No other musical ensemble is more closely associated with the history and tradition of European classical music than the Vienna Philharmonic. Over a formidable 170-year history, the musicians of this orchestra have maintained a tradition of beauty and excellence in music-makingenjoying close associations with many of the most influential composersWagner, Verdi, Bruckner, Brahms, Liszt, Strauss, Mahlerand conductorsRichter, Furtwängler, von Karajan, Bernsteinin the history of music. The Vienna Philharmonic visits Berkeley for a three-concert residency with repertoire shining a light on the orchestra's deep connection to its famous musical legacy.
 Highlights include Italian conductor Lorin Maazel, a renowned Mahler interpreter, in a program including Mahler's 4th Symphony; Brahms's Third Symphony (premiered by the Vienna Philharmonic in 1883) conducted by stellar Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons""the next big thing among young conductors"" (New York Times); and an exploration of enduring scores by influential Viennese composers (and a contemporary work from a composer who is creating in Vienna today), conducted by Franz Welser-Mösta rare chance to experience his magnificent music-making beyond Cleveland where he is music director of The Cleveland Orchestra.
 The Vienna Philharmonic's residency will also include extensive activities in the community and with UC Berkeley students, including master classes, chamber music, and a special symposium focusing on the history of the orchestra.

"Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra with Franz Welser-Möst, conductor",Performing Arts - Music,2014-03-09T23:00:00+00:00,2014-03-10T00:00:00+00:00,Zellerbach Hall,,Cal Performances,"Cal Performances' prestigious annual orchestra residency continues with a return visit by the venerable Vienna Philharmonic. You will have the unforgettable chance to experience the incredible sound of this remarkable ensemble, directed by three of the classical music world's podium greats.
One orchestra, three master conductors. No other musical ensemble is more closely associated with the history and tradition of European classical music than the Vienna Philharmonic. Over a formidable 170-year history, the musicians of this orchestra have maintained a tradition of beauty and excellence in music-makingenjoying close associations with many of the most influential composersWagner, Verdi, Bruckner, Brahms, Liszt, Strauss, Mahlerand conductorsRichter, Furtwängler, von Karajan, Bernsteinin the history of music. The Vienna Philharmonic visits Berkeley for a three-concert residency with repertoire shining a light on the orchestra's deep connection to its famous musical legacy.
 Highlights include Italian conductor Daniele Gatti, a renowned Mahler interpreter, in a program including Mahler's 4th Symphony; Brahms's Third Symphony (premiered by the Vienna Philharmonic in 1883) conducted by stellar Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons""the next big thing among young conductors"" (New York Times); and an exploration of enduring scores by influential Viennese composers (and a contemporary work from a composer who is creating in Vienna today), conducted by Franz Welser-Mösta rare chance to experience his magnificent music-making beyond Cleveland where he is music director of The Cleveland Orchestra.
 The Vienna Philharmonic's residency will also include extensive activities in the community and with UC Berkeley students, including master classes, chamber music, and a special symposium focusing on the history of the orchestra.

"ATC Lecture - Don Buchla ""How Complicated Could a Metronome Be?""",Performing Arts - Music,2014-03-11T03:30:00+00:00,2014-03-11T05:00:00+00:00,"Sutardja Dai Hall, 310 Banatao Auditorium",,Center for New Media,"Featured Performer: Don Buchla
Performers: Nannick Bonnel; Rumen Sali Shopov; Joel Davel
Educated in physics, physiology, music, and astronomy, Don Buchla's multi-faceted creativity has been applied to fields as diverse as space biophysics research, musical instrument design, and multi-media composition. Much of his work has centered on the refinement of communication channels between man and machine, notably the invention of mobility aids for the visually handicapped, the development of instrumentation for bio-feedback and physiological telemetry, and the design of interactive electronic musical instruments and performance-oriented music languages.

For this event, Buchla will present a part of his modular electronic musical instrument called the 200e. This particular module, called the Polyphonic Rhythm Generator, when used in conjunction with certain sound generating modules, forms a sophisticated metronome that finds application in odd meter music such as that commonly found in Eastern Europe and Africa, but which has only occurred in Western music in the last century or so.

Buchla will explain various details of the device and demonstrate its application in various musical settings with the assistance of Rumen Sali Shopov and Joel Davel, who will demonstrate several complex Eastern European and cross rhythms, and Buchlas wife, Nannick Bonnel, who will add a piano to Rumanian music that traditionally eschews keyboard instruments for a performance which combines both the electronic and acoustical, injecting contemporary elements into the rich traditional music of Eastern Europe.

Buchla founded the alternative band, Fried Suck, was a founding member of the 15-piece Arch Ensemble, and co-founded the Electric Weasel Ensemble, the Muse and the Fuse, and the Artists Research Collective. He served as technical director of the California Institute of the Arts, the San Francisco Tape Music Center, the Electric Circus, and the Electric Symphony. He has collaborated with such luminaries as Ami Radunskaya, David Rosenboom, Anthony Braxton, David Wessel, Morton Subotnick, Peter Apfelbaum, Suzanne Ciani, George Lewis, Nannick Bonnel, and his son, Ezra. He has developed several exotic controllers that provide expressive alternatives to traditional musical input devices; recent inventions include Thunder, Lightning III, Wind, Rain, 50 Fireflies, the Piano Bar, and the Marimba Lumina. He is currently completing a major redesign of the 200 series modular synthesizer (called the 200e) and contemplating his next project.

The ATC series is produced by the Berkeley Center for New Media (BCNM), with support from the Office of the Vice Chancellor and Provost, the Center for Information Technology in the Interest of Society (CITRIS), Meyer Sound and Theo Armour.

Music Studies Colloquium - Gjerdingen: The Institutionalization of Apprenticeship in the Great Conservatories: A Cognitive Interpretation of a Non-Verbal Praxis,Performing Arts - Music,2014-03-18T00:30:00+00:00,2014-03-18T02:00:00+00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Robert Gjerdingen,

							Northwestern University",Department of Music,"Music, like all the other crafts of pre-industrial Europe, was learned through apprenticeship. When formalized, an apprenticeship often involved a ten-year indenture of a young boy or girl to a master or mistress. Unpaid labor was exchanged for entry into the mystery of the craft. The four conservatori or foundling homes of Naples were the first to institutionalize this indenture, ultimately aggregating as many as 600 boys for the intense study of music. Just as the four Inns of Court in London raised clerkship to a higher level in English law, so the conservatories of Naples created a critical mass of young talents such as Europe had never seen. By the end of the nineteenth century almost every industrializing nation had established its own version of a music conservatory.
Perhaps the low social status of foundlings and performing musicians and their hermetic insiders praxis (a hold-over from the closed world of craft guilds) led educated writers on music to overlook or to deprecate the mindless repetitive exercises of the conservatories. Even when, at the Paris Conservatory, the work of replicating master patterns was raised to a level of finesse comparable to that of the École des Beaux-Arts, it was still not considered of any theoretical significance.
 Only from the mid-1990s did a small group of scholars begin to re-examine and rediscover what was being learned in the great conservatories. In modern terms, we can now recognize a systematic praxis aimed at the building up of a huge repertory of schemata or constructions, which collectively operated like what contemporary linguists term a usage-based grammar. The goal of such an undertaking would be to produce native speakers of a language, and the many great composers who emerged from this training would seem to support its efficacy.

The all-male drag ballet company Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, affectionately known as the Trocks, specializes in a loving critique of the conventions and traditions of ballet: campy and hysterical, but informed and beautifully executed. The company has become an international dance phenomenon, performing canonical works alongside more obscure ballets, dolled up in fabulous costumes, thick makeup, and sporting Ken-doll wigsall en pointe. The fact that men dance all the partsheavy bodies delicately balancing on toes as swans, nymphs, princessesenhances, rather than mocks, the spirit of dance as an art form, delighting knowledgeable ballet audiences and novices alike.

"Iestyn Davies, countertenor, and Thomas Dunford, lute",Performing Arts - Music,2014-03-29T04:00:00+00:00,2014-03-29T05:00:00+00:00,First Congregational Church,,Cal Performances,"Location: Intersection of Durant Ave and Dana St, Berkeley, CA
With a voice that possesses ""the delicacy and refinement of spider silk"" (Financial Times, London) and a sharp interpretive mind to match, British countertenor Iestyn Davies has entered the limelight with scene-stealing operatic roles and intimate recital programs that showcase his ""extraordinary tonal richness and imaginative phrasing"" (The Guardian, London). Davies, accompanied by Thomas Dunford on lute, sings a program of deeply poetic and emotionally dynamic late Tudor and Stuart songs by Dowland, Johnson, and Danyel, as well as a new work by the young and in-demand New York-based composer Nico Muhly.

Combining two art forms that  as Glass puts it  ""have no business being together,"" the show is a funny, lively, and heartfelt evening of storytelling. The performance's three acts cover love, loss, and the job of being a performer. Glass delivers his trademark narratives, and dancers Monica Bill Barnes and Anna Bass evoke characters through a wide range of silent art forms, allowing the three to produce ""a perfectand perfectly unexpectedunion"" (Santa Barbara Independent).

Music Studies Colloquium - Voskuhl: Music and Mechanics: Harpsichord-Playing Women Automata and Sentimental Culture in the German Enlightenment,Performing Arts - Music,2014-04-01T00:30:00+00:00,2014-04-01T02:00:00+00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Adelheid Voskuhl,

							University of Pennsylvania",Department of Music,"Two of the famous android automata made in eighteenth-century Europe displayed women playing a keyboard instrument. They were produced in Switzerland and Germany in exceptionally prolific artisan environments. The artisans designed them so that they not merely played music but also performed contemporary sentimental-musical body techniques (through moving their eyes, heads, and torsos) to communicate affects to the audience that were generated by the musical piece. My talk investigates the artisan and musical-cultural environments in which androids and their meanings were produced in the eighteenth century and probes also the boundaries between such different economic and cultural environments. The talk's second part traces how eighteenth-century musical automata's interpretations changed significantly during the industrial revolutions of the 19th and the wars of the 20th centuries: literary and cultural critics detached them from their original musical-historical context and appropriated them as harbingers of the catastrophes of industrial modernity. The musical element of the mechanics of the androids helps me rescue this part of their android identity and thus re-visit both technical and cultural modernities.

Kronos, now celebrating its 40th anniversary, is an incubator of ideas, always ready to ask us to reflect on our role in world events, and the history we are all creating.

Music Studies Colloquium - Wong: Rereading Ethnomusicology for Gender and Erotics,Performing Arts - Music,2014-04-08T00:30:00+00:00,2014-04-08T02:00:00+00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Deborah Wong,

							UC Riverside",Department of Music,"How and why did gender studies move so quickly through ethnomusicology, and then (mostly) disappear? Why has sexuality studies barely made any appearance at all, despite musics central role in shaping desire? Ethnomusicology moved to a post-gender stance with lightning speed. That is, after key publications about women/gender and music in the 1980s-90s, ethnomusicologists began to add the phrase and gender to their arguments but to a great extent stopped focusing on it. As Ellen Koskoff has written, after a brief spurt in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, work in feminist and genderist ethnomusicology seemed to slow in relation to that of musicology(Koskoff 2005, 90). 
I offer a reclamation model meant to dialogically regroup, recoup, and reformulate existing ethnomusicological scholarship. Attention to gendered orders of music is missing from much of our most treasured literature, and I aim to reread itto read it anew, to read it with new eyesnot in order to rescue it but to fold the gesture of critique into our work as I make visible the invisibility of gender in so much of our best scholarship. This is in some ways homage and in others an openly counterfactual history. I will reread my own book on Thai music by folding in current media coverage of spectacularly misogynistic demonstrations against the female Prime Minister. I will reread several key monographs by other ethnomusicologists to consider the range of acts available to usradical rereading, evocative/poetic rereading, mournful rereadingwhile arguing that this agentive feminist act of reading (refusing the apparent absence) is an extension of the gaze exerted by subalterns of many kinds in many places. I aim to activate a bifocal consciousness and to exert the black look articulated by bell hooks to theorize a reading method for ethnomusicologists that traces the ghostly presence of gender and erotics, reading around their apparent absence for their outlines and sonic traces. I will draw from the abundance of theories addressing the act of oppositional watching/listening and theories for rereading from philosophy and education, which emphasize how re-knowing and re-cognition is part of the rereading process. Can a second reading open up a third space?
Neither a rescue operation nor an apologist celebration, this is instead a deeply necessary and respectful effort to reengage with (rather than disengage from) leading scholarship by ethnomusicologists that has mostly turned a blind eye toward gender and sexuality. I offer both a practical method and a theory of rereading drawn from feminist theory, minoritarian studies, and translation studies.

The iconic Texan is the creative genius behind historic recordings like ""Crazy,"" ""Hello Walls,"" ""Red Headed Stranger"" and ""Stardust."" His career has spanned six decades. His catalog boasts more than 200 albums. He's earned every conceivable award and honor to be bestowed a person in his profession. He has also amassed reputable credentials as an author, actor and activist.

In 2004, the Academy of Country Music bestowed him with the prestigious Gene Weed Special Achievement Award honoring Nelson's ""unprecedented and genre-defying contributions to popular music over his nearly 50-year career."" The March 2006 release of 'You Don't Know Me: The Songs of Cindy Walker,' a collection of 13 classics written by Country Music Hall of Fame songwriter Cindy Walker, earned Nelson a Grammy nomination for Best Country Album, augmenting a career that has been recognized with eight Grammy wins, a President's Merit Award, a Grammy Legend Award and the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award.

The Chemical Brothers, Basement Jaxx and Fatboy Slim would headline festivals from now until the end of days. The only way a new UK dance act could reach millions of people was to get a song on Masterchef. But in less than a year, Disclosure have turned all that on its head. The most successful British dance act in a generation, they've not only soared to the top of the charts and sold out venues across the world - they've also changed the nature of British pop, opening the door for underground dance acts to flood the mainstream. All this from a couple of brothers that only just finished school. The eldest, Guy, is 22. The youngest, Howard, is just 19.

Reception and photo booth hosted by the BAM/PFA Student Committee.
Check this out. No: Czech this out. We lift the (iron) curtain on Valerie and Her Week of Wonders (Jaromil Jires, 1969), a cult classic that actually deserves its rep. This surreal cinema fable is half erotic tabloid, half gothic daydream, and all guilty pleasure. Valerie is a chaste thirteen-year-old whose awakening desire transforms her quaint village into an imp-infested realm of repressed sexuality. Everyone has their way and so too will our DJs wholl strip Valeries wonders of sonority and add their own promiscuous scores. The evening begins with a surrealist fashion show.

The Something
The Something is a conglomeration of possibilities for exploration and observation. Participants might begin by tentatively plunking a string, picking up a fabric or holding a video camera. Eventually, the sounds gather, the visuals evolve, and the dynamics of our actions coalesce into moments of ordered harmony, dissolve back into chaos, and then re-emerge ordered once again. The spectator simultaneously becomes actor and observer. The project seeks to stimulate intersubjective creative production and emancipated collaboration.

The National: with guests: Portugal. The Man,Performing Arts - Music,2014-04-27T04:00:00+00:00,2014-04-27T05:00:00+00:00,Hearst Greek Theatre,,Another Planet Entertainment,"'Trouble Will Find Me,' the most self-assured collection of songs produced by the National in its 14-year career, is a tribute to fully evolved artistic vision - and, somewhat less mystically, to sleep deprivation. Last January, following a twenty-two month tour to promote the band's previous record, 'High Violet,' guitarist Aaron Dessner returned home to Brooklyn, where the fitfulness of his newborn daughter threw Aaron into a more or less sustained fugue state - ""sleepless and up all the time,"" as he puts it. Punch-drunk, he shuffled into the band's studio (situated in Aaron's backyard), where he amused himself writing musical fragments that he then sent over to vocalist Matt Berninger. Recalls Matt of Aaron, ""He'd be so tired while he was playing his guitar and working on ideas that he wouldn't intellectualize anything. In the past, he and Aaron's twin brother, Bryce would be reluctant to send me things that weren't in their opinion musically interesting - which I respected, but often those would be hard for me to connect to emotionally. This time around, they sent me sketch after sketch that immediately got me on a visceral level."" From beginning to end, 'Trouble Will Find Me' possesses the effortless and unself-conscious groove of a downstream swimmer. It's at times lush and at others austere, suffused with insomniacal preoccupations that skirt despair without succumbing to it.

Named Musical America's 2012 Musicians of the Year, cellist David Finckel and pianist Wu Han are a force of nature: praised for the boldness, imagination, and collaborative intimacy of their performances, as well as the vision and energy they bring to their work as chamber music ambassadors. Their ""finely tuned partnership"" (New York Times), which just celebrated its 30th year, has brought them accolades for stunning performances and creative programming on both coasts, including their co-directorship of the Music@Menlo festival and institute. This season, the duo takes us on a journey through the centuries, from Bach to the birth of 20th-century music with Debussy and Britten.

In preparing the musicians for this performance, Payne will teach the principles, structures, and techniques of humpback whale song though several group sound experiments, including, but not limited to, deep listening exercises with audio recordings (garnered from her groundbreaking collection of field recordings with ex-husband Roger Payne, Songs of the Humpback Whale) and analyzing spectrograms of whalesong through a musical, rather than research-oriented, lens. Along with these musical building blocks, she will also expand on the various functions that whale song serves in whale culture. Gesundheit will aid in translating Paynes concepts and instructions into performance strategies.
The kora is the central instrument in the Griot tradition of using song to transmit news and stories, and to mark ceremonial occasions.

After dressing down the fifties with Some Like It Hot, director Wilder comes out swingin for the liberated sixties. Bud Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a low-level lackey at an insurance company who trades his bachelor pad for promotional benefits. A parade of philandering managers passes through his pad, complicated further when the head of HR (Fred MacMurray) begins ogling one of the apartment buildings elevator operators (Shirley MacLaine). Theres nothing funnier than the gray flannel suit set in the throes of libidinous buffoonery. But hapless Bud realizes that for the possibility of happiness, he must shed his tightly tailored suit and get a life, not life insurance.

							Eastern Illinois University",Center for Korean Studies (CKS),"In 1923, a 7.9 magnitude earthquake shook Tokyo and Yokohoma, essentially leveling Japans two largest cities and causing more than 100,000 deaths. The subsequent aftershocks, fires, and ensuing panic bred rumors that malcontent Koreans living in Japan were setting the fires, poisoning water wells, and plotting a revolution. To prevent this alleged uprising, vigilantes along with police and the military massacred more than 6,000 Koreans.

Partly to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the massacre, two unreleased rare documentaries from Japan have been touring the United States since last September. The films feature interviews with Japanese and Korean survivors, and the first of the two sequel films ""Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans From the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo, 1923 will be shown. The movie was directed by Choonkong Oh, a Korean resident of Japan, and is in Japanese and Korean with English subtitles.

The documentary is under an hour long, and will be followed by a discussion featuring Jinhee Lee, a history professor at Eastern Illinois University whose research focuses on the competing narratives of collective violence in the Japanese empire.

Introduction/Paolo Cherchi Usai


Paolo Cherchi Usai is senior curator of moving image at George Eastman House and cofounder of the Pordenone Silent Film Festival
The recent discovery in Italy of a nitrate work print of Orson Welless first professional foray into cinema, superbly restored by George Eastman House, reveals the pre-Kane auteur falling in love with filmmaking and the addictive art of editing. When Welles took on the direction of Mercury Theatres 1938 stage production of Too Much Johnson, William Gillettes 1894 farce of philandering and mistaken identities, he decided to use film as a a prologue for each act of the play. Despite shooting over four hours of footage, Welles never completed the three-part film, and for decades it was believed lost. Mercurys ensemble players, with Joseph Cotten in the lead role, share Welless pleasure and playfulness in this inventive homage to silent comedy. Already in early 1938, at the age of twenty-two, Welles had a cinematic sensibility that went radically against the grain of prevailing Hollywood practices, defying and outrunningby means of an extreme pictorialismthe finely tuned, script-centered classicism of the studios golden age (Richard Brody, The New Yorker). With on-location sequences of the serial lover fleeing across rooftops and through markets of lower Manhattan, Too Much Johnson is also a fascinating document of the prewar cityscape.

(Bakushu). The radiant Setsuko Hara is a happily single young woman who, in the eyes of her traditional family, cant be happy at all until shes married. Unbeknownst to them, however, she has her eyes set on someone, a widower with a young child. About Early Summer, Ozu stated, ""I was interested in getting much deeper than just the story itself; I wanted to depict the cycles of life, the transience of life. . . . Consequently, I didn't force the action, but tried to leave some spaces unfilled . . . leave viewers with a pleasant aftertaste."" As Donald Richie notes, ""These tiny empty moments are the pores in an Ozu picture through which the movie breathes. They define the film by their emptiness."" The ""aftertaste"" is a bit sad, however; as a daughter marries, a family dissolves, leaving parents alone to contemplate their life and their hopes for the children, to savor transience. Their gaze extends the film beyond the edges of the screen.

Even his equally demented therapist Fritz Fassbender (a loopy-locked Peter Sellers) cant break him of his kitten conquest fixation. Woody Allens first feature script is an antic Parisian party, filled with feline femmes like Romy Schneider, Paula Prentiss, and Ursula Andress. Howled by Tom Jones, the famous Burt Bacharach theme song is like a ribald anthem for the oversexed. Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

A single-channel video installation which explores the rarefied world of Tibetan Buddhist debate. Built around three sets of debates dealing with the basic Buddhist concepts of impermanence, lack of self-existence, and dependent-arising, the piece allows the viewer an opportunity to participate in this unique dialectical practice while highlighting its relevance to the modern world.

Ritu Sarin and Tenzing Sonam have been making films since their student days in the San Francisco Bay Area in the early 80s, including several documentaries, video installations and one dramatic feature film.
Ritu Sarin studied at Miranda House in Delhi University and went on to finish her studies at California College of the Arts in Oakland. Tenzing Sonam was born in Darjeeling in India to Tibetan refugee parents. He studied at St Stephens College, Delhi University, and then specialized in documentary filmmaking at the Graduate School of Journalism, University of California, Berkeley.

For the setting of his first film in color, Ray chose the scenic Himalayan hillside resort of Darjeeling, where the elite flee from the heat of Calcutta. Here, one family vacation turns into a family showdown, as a wealthy, Anglicized father tries to rule over his stifled wife, libertine son, unloved eldest daughter, and rebellious younger one. Rays most creative and detailed look at contemporary Indias cross-cultures (Albert Johnson), Kanchenjungha is one of the great directors most Chekhovian works, a tale of manners and mores played out amid a landscape as dramatic as the conflicts on display.

We couldnt wait for official spring, but its Springtime for Hitler nonetheless. A has-been Broadway producer, Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel at his seediest best) has a great schemehell bilk his investors out of dough by producing a surefire failure. Bialystock and his CPA Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) take on a goose-stepping tribute to Hitler, a musical no less, with spaced-out hippie Lorenzo St. DuBois, a.k.a. L.S.D. (Dick Shawn), as the Führer with a song in his heart. For his first film, Mel Brooks had the good sense to lead with bad taste. This highly vulgar satire definitely stirred up a furor of its own.

Take the Money and Run is like the fantasy life of a borscht belt comedianfrom schlemiel to hard case in one rapid rubbery, ah, robbery. Allens directorial debut puts into place his blundering boychik who cant make time, so he does the crime. Virgil Starkwell (Allen), who never saw a bank he couldnt get arrested in, survives prison and escape, all for lithe Louise (Janet Margolin), too pretty to pickpocket. Parodying a fifties crime film with its documentary toneremember Virgils parents with their Groucho disguisesthis felonious feature was shot around San Francisco with Q as its pressure-cooker prison. A film this funny should be illegal.

Introduction/Dilip Basu


Dilip Basu is research professor of humanities and founding director of the Satyajit Ray Film Study Center at the University of California Santa Cruz

Rays personal favorite of his works, Charulata follows one womans romantic and intellectual yearning in a late nineteenth-century India trapped under a constricting mix of Hindu aestheticism and Victorian morality (Albert Johnson). Married to a successful, seemingly liberal publisher, Charulata (a stunning Madhabi Mukherjee) passes her lonely days with embroidery and daydreams, until her husbands handsome cousin arrives to distract her with poetry and attention. Subtly drawing out the cracks of a marriage in crisis, as well as the flowering of a womans independence, this dignified character study is based on a Rabindranath Tagore novella, and flows with the grace of Flaubert and James. For The Manchester Guardian, it is simply a masterpiece, while Ray himself called it my best.

A film about the children of Marx and Coca-Cola by the child of Brecht and Hollywood. Paul (Jean-Pierre Léaud), fresh out of the army, sets about trying to find la tendresse among the young set in Paris. He falls in love with Madeleine (Chantal Goya), an aspiring yé-yé singer, but she is as indifferent to Pauls Hollywood-style romancing as she is oblivious to his political passions. From the first full-frame close-up of Paul, reading aloud, we are reminded that JPL is the perfect mouthpiece for JLG: his subsuming self-pity is humorous and he knows it, even while he speaks the truth. The film is constructed rather like a highbrow comic book, a pastiche of skits and journalistic bits, encounters and opinion polls, an introduction to the ubiquity of media we take for granted today. Godard announces it as fifteen precise actions, but it is the dance between precision and improvisation that makes it a film of great and surprising beauty.

(Nayak). A sharp-witted, serious young journalist finds herself stuck on a train with a movie superstar in Rays surprising examination of intellectual and popular cultures. Collisions are expected when the bespectacled intellectual (Sharmila Tagore) and the blustery movie star (Uttam Kumar, himself a Bengali matinee idol) wind up sharing tales and time on the train together, but soon the star finds himself revealing a surprising intelligence and self-doubt, as well as secrets from the past. And for the journalist, what begins as the hope of a star exposé turns into the glimpse of one mans failures and dreams, as well as cinemas (and fames) capability to destroy itself. Many believed the intellectual Ray was anticommercial or antipopular cinema, but The Hero offers a perceptive, empathetic look at that worlds dreams, hopes, and artistic dilemmas. Critic Albert Johnson described it best: it is a realistic film about the unreality of dreams.

"Pierrot le fou, Jean-Luc Godard (France, 1965)",Film - Feature,2014-03-10T01:30:00+00:00,2014-03-10T02:30:00+00:00,PFA Theater,,Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive,"I wanted to do a kind of You Only Live Once, a story of the last romantic couple alive, Godard said. Certainly, Ferdinand (Jean-Paul Belmondo) and Marianne (Anna Karina) are Godards last romantic couple, and maybe even his first: their adventure in eros and danger on the Riviera fulfills the dream escape of the lovers in Breathless, Band of Outsiders, and Alphaville. Godard reverses the Breathless story with Belmondo playing the fool implicated in the gangster world of Marianne (last name: Renoir), with whom he escapes a stupid bourgeois existence and reinvents love. The pathos of modern living, powerfully expressed through Godards experimental, philosophical exposition, includes ennui, accident, and absurdity among the forces destructive to love. Curious that the film described as Godard's most freewheeling film should involve a murder-suicide. Shot by Raoul Coutard in Scope and brilliant primary colors, Pierrot le fou is ravishing, and very moving.

"Screening of ""Campaign 2"" and Q&A with filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda",Film - Documentary,2014-03-12T02:00:00+00:00,2014-03-12T05:30:00+00:00,"Sutardja Dai Hall, 310 Banatao Auditorium","Kazuhiro Soda,
							Filmmaker",Center for Japanese Studies (CJS),"In response to the Fukushima disaster, Yama-san is running an election campaign with an anti-nuclear message. But unlike last time, he has no money, no machine, no nothing.

In his previous 2005 by-election depicted in ""Campaign"", Kazuhiko ""Yama-san"" Yamauchi was the official candidate of the LDP, headed by then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. He won the vacant seat, fully backed by the LDP's political machine. However, for the election in 2007, the LDP did not endorse Yama-san, and backed a different candidate. For the past 4 years, Yama-san has stayed away from politics, living as a ""house husband"" to raise his newborn son Yuki.

So, this election in 2011 is a come-back attempt by Yama-san after 4 quiet years. But the situation is not so forgiving. The total budget for his campaign is now only 84,720 Japanese Yen (about $850)  all for printing posters and postcards.

Does he even stand a chance?

Filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda debuted with ""Campaign"" in 2007 at the Berlinale, and has been winning international awards with his observational film series such as ""Mental"" (2008), ""Peace"" (2010), and ""Theatre 1 & 2"" (2012). ""Campaign 2"" candidly captures the mechanical lives of the Japanese people, firmly adhered to even in the midst of a disaster where radioactive material is falling from the sky. Soda's camera, which had maintained an outsider's position in ""Campaign, gradually gets ensnared in the situation. Conflict between the filmmaker and the subjects eventually escalates and finally comes to a head.

Superb documentary . . . almost unbearably moving.Richard Corliss, Time Magazine

Tomas Young enlisted immediately after 9/11. He was shot and paralyzed after having served in Iraq less than a week. In this intimate observational film, his body, wracked with pain, is damning evidence against war. His daily struggles are intercut with Congresss 2002 vote authorizing military force against Iraq, a debate in which truth is exposed as another casualty. Young develops into an articulate, outspoken critic of the war. Today, seven years after the film premiered, Youngs suffering from his devastating wounds has only worsened.

Luckily, Van Peebles won out, substituting the darkly sarcastic Godfrey Cambridge as the bigoted suburbanite. No amount of scrubbing can remove the black and finally this sudden negro ventures out to a world permeated with racism, at work, on the street, in his own neighborhood. And the humor?

Robert Aldrich, Otto Preminger, David Goodis, Marianne Faithfull, and Kenji Mizoguchi all get nodsbut so do Richard Nixon, Robert McNamara, and the Moroccan leftist Ben Barka. Karinas character, Paula Nelson, scours an imagined Atlantic City for her missing boyfriend, listening to Marxist manifestos and encountering shady criminals while looking impossibly chic in a series of vibrant dresses and minis. An extremely loose adaptation of the crime novel The Jugger, Made in U.S.A. is a freewheeling, self-referential exploration of Hollywood cinema and simmering sixties politics. Or, as Paula famously puts it: We were in a political movie, meaning Walt Disney with blood.

Twentysomething Farah Mahtab is eager to shake the unwanted moniker of virgin, but her sex life is a litany of awkward, fumbled encounters. When best friends Roopa and KJ propose a cross-country road trip to stump for presidential nominee John Kerry, there is a not-so-secret hope that the trip will provide Farah the sweet release she craves. The trio soon finds that wide-eyed optimism isnt always a surefire catalyst for sex or politicseven in a swing state. Meera Menons directorial debut artfully captures a generations mixture of hope and youthful disillusionment in the fledgling years of a post-9/11 world, and points a finger at the way national discourse shapes young womens identity and sexual politics. In an ode to female companionship à la Thelma and Louise with all the raunchy humor of Bridesmaids, Menon subverts the classic tropes of the road trip film in favor of a new American feminism, complete with discussions of female grooming and sexual desire. Winner of the Nora Ephron prize for best female film at the Tribeca Film Festival.

By now every Thai child knows the tale: wounded country boy Mak returns home to his village after the warthis time around with his four best buddies in towto reunite with his love and their son, only something is not quite right. While Mak gets mushy with his devoted bride (Thai/Belgian model Davika Hoorne), the four friends gamely set up in a neighboring house thats conveniently been abandoned by frightened villagerseveryone seems to believe Maks wife is a ghost, and not without good reason. Between all the stringy long black hair, outrageous physical gags, and genuine scares on display, you might gloss over the films blink-and-you'll-miss-it barrage of on-point cultural references and its luxe cinematography. Try to keep your eyes open: Pee Mak is a rare treatcertified art and certified pop.

Rea Tajiri, critically acclaimed director of History and Memory: For Akiko and Takashige (SFIAAFF 91) and Strawberry Fields (SFIAAFF 98), opens her new film with a question: What does it mean to own land? With the purchase of her house in Lordville, New York, Tajiri sets out to understand our relationship to place, but does so through the filter of experimental film language. Dziga Vertov, believing in cinemas potential to revolutionize our perception and relationship to the world, wrote in his infamous 1922 manifesto: We believe that the time is at hand when we shall be able to hurl into space the hurricanes of movement, reined in by our tactical lassoes. Through anecdotes from residents, an environmental scientist, and a Native American genealogist, Lordville reins in unusual stories buried within the everydaypowerful floods, ancestral secrets, and colonial violenceto probe the material and immaterial traces of a towns history. The film compels us into an act of listening and sensing that orients us toward the land that we have settled our being upon.

(Ba ma bu zai jia). Temperamental Jiale is a terror of a ten-year-old. At home, he viciously gives his very pregnant mother the cold shoulder. At school, he gets into fights and buries himself in a scrapbook of lottery numbers. At the end of their rope, Jiales parents hire a Filipina domestic worker to take care of the house, and more importantly, to keep Jiale at bay. They cant predict that shell grow to know more about the Lim family than any of its actual members. Winner of the Camera dOr at Cannes and Best Picture at the Golden Horse Awards (the top prize in Chinese-language film), Ilo Ilo is the riveting quasi-autobiographical first feature by twenty-nine-year-old Anthony Chen. Set against the backdrop of the 1990s Asian financial crisis, the film slowly reveals a family on the brink, watching desperately as self-control slips from their grip. These are Chens pained memories of growing up in a Chinese household in Singapore. This testimony of global labor and a multiethnic Singapore continue to resonate, and the composed nakedness with which Chen renders them announces one of cinemas most promising new talents.

The Trials of Muhammad Ali covers the most explosive crossroads of Alis life. When Cassius Clay became Muhammad Ali, his conversion to Islam and refusal to serve in the Vietnam War left him banned from boxing and facing a five-year prison sentence. When Ali chose faith and conscience over fame and fortune, it resonates far beyond the boxing ring, striking issues of race, faith and identity that continue to confront us all today.

Restored Print!


(Kapurush). One of Rays most light-hearted works, The Coward (intended to screen as a double bill with The Holy Man) was intentionally designed as a comic make-weight between more serious fare, but still showcases Rays consummate craftsmanship and attention to detail. A junior scriptwriter from Calcutta finds himself in a backwater tea plantation looking for local flavor, and discovers that his good-natured, frequently drunk host has a gorgeous, extremely intelligent wife, who is also . . . his former lover. Nerves, emotions, alcohol, and more quickly flow as this bizarre love triangle reaches its (un)natural conclusion. Light in touch, gently humorous, the ironic The Coward is far from complimentary to the male animal (MoMA).

(Mahapurush). The Holy Man is a comic exposé of the folly of the superstitiously devout, who make it possible for confidence men to earn a living posing as saintsin this case, a Babaji who claims to be ageless. Looking for dupes, this holy man finds a truth-seeker with far more money than brains, and quickly sets about to cleanse him of earthly distractions, like cash. Like The Coward, The Holy Man was created as a quick comic stopover between more serious films, and offers a side of Ray unknown to most: populist, funny, and willing to try anything.

Rays most overtly Renoir-ish film, this might almost be a remake of Une Partie de Campagne, transposed to another time and place and through another sensibility. Instead of the French bourgeois family setting off for a picnic, four young men leave Calcutta for a few days in the country, trailing their westernized careerist attitudes, a middle class indifference to the lower orders, a self-satisfaction that leaves them closed to experience. Out of a series of delightfully funny mishaps as the visitors eagerly try to pursue acquaintance with their two promisingly attractive neighbors, Ray gradually distills a magical world of absolute stasis: a shimmering summers day, a tranquil forest clearing, the two women strolling in a shady avenue, wistful yearnings as love and the need for love echo plangently. Elsewhere jobs have to be won or lost, problems faced and solved, but not here; an illusion of course, revealed as time lifts its suspension but leaves one of the quartet a changed man, the other three assailed by tiny waves of self-doubt. Beautifully shot and acted, its probably Rays masterpiece.

(Pratidwandi). Created amid the growing social unrest and political violence of India (and the world) post-1969, and specifically responding to Bengals armed Naxalite radical movement, The Adversary is Ray at his most openly political, yet also Ray at his most compassionate and even humorous. A young college graduate seeks employment (or at least respect) in Calcutta, that nightmare city (as Ray described it at the time), and finds neither. Indifferent to joining polite society, his younger brother chooses revolution instead. This is Rays funniest, most piercing film, wrote Pauline Kael; its humanism is like the quality of Olmis Il Posto.

When McElwee finds himself increasingly exasperated by his sons addiction to technology, he decides to revisit his own youth, retracing a trip to France he made in his early twenties. Armed with some of the first photographs he ever took, McElwee searches for a wedding photographer he worked for as an assistant and a woman he lived with for a short time. Hes also carrying a digital camera, his first foray into this technology. The resulting film, which draws on his archive of family footage, is a poetic meditation on looking back in order to move forward.

Several of the pioneers of ethnographic filmLorna and John Marshall, Robert Gardner, Timothy Aschmade crucial contributions to the genre in Cambridge; and in more recent years the Sensory Ethnography Lab, founded by Lucien Castaing-Taylor in 2002, has become an important studio for the production of films that provide sensory experiences of people-in-place. Tonights program features three of the SELs veterans, plus a recent film by Alfred Guzzetti, whose filmmaking and teaching has invigorated the Cambridge scene for more than forty years.

The phrase was uttered first by Chance (Peter Sellers), a simple-minded gardener who has learned everything from the glowing television tube. When misfortune sets him on the streets of Washington, D.C., he is helpless until inadvertently rescued by Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine), wife of a financial tycoon, played by Melvyn Douglas. Chance is reinvented as Chauncey Gardiner by his influential hosts and his simplistic views are mistaken for wisdom by politicians starved for frank malarkey. As if anticipating the Reagan era, Hal Ashbys darkly cautionary comedy is more a punch than a punchline.

In Conversation/Atsushi Funahashi and David Slater


David Slater is an associate professor of cultural anthropology at Sophia University, Tokyo, who has published works focusing on social media, information, and political activism following Japan's 3.11 crisis.

On March 11, 2011, a tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake hit Japans coast, crippling the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The devastation exacted by the tsunami was compounded by radiation released by the failing reactors. The nearby town of Futaba was abandoned,leaving behind a wreckage of homes, contaminated crops, and expiring livestock. Within weeks, director Funahashi arrived to observe Futabas displaced community, now nuclear refugees from the exclusion zone. What he found were evacuation centers crowded with intrepid people yearning to return home, but caught in a limbo of governmental inaction and evasiveness. Join us for Funahashis astute documentary, as well as updates about the disaster with no end.

Academy awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, and Sound Design


Introduction/Paul Zaentz
Paul Zaentz, Saul Zaentzs nephew, is a film producer

Peter Shaffer rewrote history in his black opera Amadeus, then rewrote the play for Formans color extravaganza. It takes the form of a confession, thirty-two years after Mozarts death, by his supposed murderer, Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a mediocre composer who alone perceived the sublime genius of Mozarts music. Seen through Salieris eyes, Tom Hulces Mozart never veers from a cartoon portrayal of the obscene child; he is indeed an unlikely if not unworthy vessel of divine inspiration, yet paradoxically, one whose talent could only be explained by divine intervention. Forman returned to his native Czechoslovakia to film Amadeus amid the still glorious eighteenth-century architecture of Prague.

(Alphaville, une étrange aventure de Lemmy Caution). Contraband poetry . . . and consequently the more precious, Godard wrote about Cocteaus Orphée. In Alphaville, Godard establishes a techno-fascistic city in which poetryand love and conscienceare contraband, therefore mortally dangerous. His dream/nightmare world is created with mysterious, dread-filled, and hauntingly beautiful images. Black shadows are pools of ambiguity, glass surfaces reflect fear. But Alphaville, the capital of pain, is Paris, underlit. The plot is a mixture of comic strip, film noir, and science fiction, as special agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine) is sent on an intergalactic mission to dispose of the diabolical scientist von Braun, whose mechanical brainchild Alpha 60 tortures the populace with logic. A wonderful moment in this surprisingly moving film finds the poker-faced, hard-as-nails Caution trying to communicate the meaning of the word love to von Brauns robotized daughter Natasha (Anna Karina), who must relearn language as a first step toward individuality.

(Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne). Into his much-loved screen adaptation of a fairy tale written by his grandfather, Satyajit Ray weaves elements of folklore, classical and popular music, dance, and drama. Some people have classified it as a film for children, writes Marie Seton, Rays biographer. If so, then it is also for the grown-up in the sense that Alice in Wonderland has its adult levels. Others have seen a Brechtian quality in Goopy. However interpreted, Goopy satirizes power and the absurdity of war. The tale is of two village boys, one who doesnt sing, the other who doesnt play drums, and both of whom have been expelled from the village for trying. They meet in the forest, where their playing attracts the King of the Ghosts and his entourage, who perform what Albert Johnson describes as a Bengali rockout that is immediately among the greatest sequences in the history of Indian cinema. Granted three wishes by the Ghost King, Goopy and Bagha are equipped with magic slippers, musical ability, and the promise of food and clothing for a lifetime. They set out on a host of uproarious adventures, through which they meet twin kings of warring realms, and in the end are beautifully rewarded for their work for peace.

Nemecs technique is as emotionally intuitive as it is masterful, purposefully scrambling past and present, handheld realism (a breathless opening tracking shot) and Buñuellian surrealism.Time Out

(Demanty noci). A brilliantly stylized, expressionist nightmare in film form, Diamonds of the Night turns the horrors of the Holocaust into existential fear. Concentration camp jackets on their backs, two boys hop off a train and start running, and with that startling image Diamonds of the Night is off and running as well, never stopping as it careens through a night of darkness and constant movement. Pure cinema at its finest, Diamonds has only a few lines of dialogue and no real plot; its brilliantly fluid black-and-white camerawork, mixed with hallucinatory close-ups and runs through the forest, capture everything we need to know. Nemecs portrait of a group of doddering old men, gathering to eagerly hunt down the boys, also tells us all we need to know of the society that exists around them. The title of the story by Czech writer Arnost Lustig from which the film is drawn, Darkness Casts No Shadow, appropriately captures its mood of moral nightfall.

(Loin de Vietnam). Recently rereleased after being long unavailable theatrically, Far from Vietnam is a unique collaboration by seven noted directors (William Klein, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Lelouch, Joris Ivens, Chris Marker, Agnès Varda, and Alain Resnais), produced as a fundraiser for the Vietnamese. Much of the credit for this goes to Chris Marker, who put it all together. But there was also a team spirit created by the situation in Vietnam that led the artists to want to speak out, directly and boldly, in a group work. The result is a provocative treatment of footage shot in Vietnam, France, the U.S., and Cuba.

(The Job, a.k.a. The Sound of Trumpets). An ingenuous lad just out of school is stuffed into a suit, shoved out of his suburban home, and pointed toward Milan in search of un posto sicuro: a steady job. In his deceptively simple style of observation, Olmi follows young Domenicos progress through the dehumanizing labyrinth of the corporate world; along the way he finds and loses a girl scurrying through her own groove in the maze. On his promotion to clerk at a back-room desk, Domenico arrives with his cache of papers, paperclips, and paste-pots for the first day of the end of his life. A nonprofessional actor, Sandro Panseri, portrays Domenico, who with his wide, sorrowful eyes witnesses the tragicomedy that is life for his older colleagues. Il posto is a deeply moving explication of alienated labor, the meaningless regimentation that signifies being an adult.

After his return from exile, Nemec delved immediately into filmmaking. Unlike his generational peers, he did not rely on existing structures and began producing films independently, continuing to develop a personal style without regard for generally accepted rules. Experimenting with digital video formats, this counterpart to Kafkas Letter to Father finds the director probing his own psyche in the form of a confessional dialogue with his long deceased mother. Nemec turns a fish-eye lens on himself and his birthplace of Prague to create an experimental personal essay film, an autodocumentary, which the jury at Locarno International Film Festival recognized with a Golden Leopard for the best video film in 2001.

(O slavnosti a hostech). Notoriously banned forever by an incensed Czech government, A Report on the Party and Guests is political parable at its most cutting, dryly presenting a society where conformity is the norm and where power is contained not through brute force, but a gentle hand in the back. The revelries of some Sunday afternoon countryside loungers (including such New Wave luminaries as Ester Krumbachova, writer of Daisies, and Ewald Schorm, director of End of a Priest) are suddenly interrupted by sinister thugs, who blithely plop down a desk in a field and start taking reports. The group soon find themselves invited to a party by a seemingly gentle man, of which their attendance is strangely mandatory, or else. With cues from Kafka, Ionesco, and life itself, A Report is one of the most devastating satires ever made, revealing the structures of power that exist in all states and society.

Nemecs piece, The Imposters, follows two old men who regale each other with tales of their many accomplishments and victories, which may or may not have actually occurred.

Company Limited is an impeccable ideological tract detailing the exact price in human dignity and decency to be paid for a stake in the corridors of power.Tom Milne, Monthly Film Bulletin
The hero is the amiable, self-satisfied, and ambitious young sales manager of a factory manufacturing electric fans, comfortably married and nicely set up in a smart apartment. The arrival from the country of his beautiful, intelligent, naive young sister-in-law unsettles him at the same moment as a crisis in his department awakens him to his own ability to fight dirty. He gets his directorship and emerges from the experience a good deal wiser and rather less certain of himself. . . . . This is one of Rays best films. The domestic relationshipthe unrealized triangle of the man and the two girlsis revealed more by what is left out than by what is shown. At the same time it is one of Rays most richly comic films, with shrewd satire on the American-styled business world of Calcutta.

This Parisian cell, consisting of five young peopleVeronique, a student; Guillaume, an actor; Henri, a chemical engineer; Kirilov, an artist, and Yvonne, a country girldeliberates the need for action while gorged on the predigested language of revolution. In an almost slapstick assemblage of skits that joins Pop to agitprop, La Chinoise charts the progress of these radicals as they veer from playing at revolution to making it. All the while, Godard advances his self-possessed film forward with a lucidity of means that refuses distraction. La Chinoise speaks first as a prophetic clarification of brooding unrest, soon verified by May 68, and then as a vehicle for radical theater seeking use beyond reflection. OK, its fiction, says one cell member, but it brings me closer to reality.

Adapted from Milan Kunderas novel, this grand romance begins its vaporous plot during the Prague Spring of 1968, an optimistic moment when socialism had a gentler hand. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Tomas, a philandering surgeon who favors lightness, a disconnection from the weight of history. His sexual appetite is an aspect of this flight from commitment, and rarely does he repeat himself, frolicking instead from woman to woman with the seductive command Take off your clothes. This ends when he meets two women of weighty will: Sabina (Lena Olin), whose own appetite is ravenous; and Tereza (Juliette Binoche), an innocent from the country with a more provincial palate. Then the Soviet tanks arrive and lightness becomes a luxury. With the handsome trio of thespians at the center of the film, cinematography by the great Sven Nykvist, a script by Buñuel collaborator Jean-Claude Carrière, and cutting by master editor Walter Murch, The Unbearable Lightness of Being finds just the right balance between weighty aesthetics and the desires of the soul. Jan Nemec, who served as an advisor on the film, provided footage of the invasion; watch for his cameo appearance as a photographer during this sequence.

2014 Academy Award Nomination for Best Documentary Feature


I have not seen a film as powerful, surreal, and frightening in at least a decadeIt is unprecedented in the history of cinema.Werner Herzog

I know a good location for a torture scene, says an aging movie buff early in The Act of Killing. Like a demonic location scout, this self-professed gangster and notorious death-squad chief leads the way to a site of atrocity haunted by the ghosts of his victims. At once a horrifying history lesson, a riveting portrait of unrepentant evil, and a shocking treatise on the widespread influence and malleable meanings of American cinema, Joshua Oppenheimers flabbergasting documentary recounts the Indonesian genocide of the mid-1960s, when paramilitary forces obliterated millions of suspected communists, left-wing intellectuals, and other enemies of the fascist state. A handful of perpetrators, never brought to justice, recall the good old days of moviegoing and murder, claiming to have modeled their sadistic behavior on the violent American gangster flicks they watched at local theaters. Hoping to rewrite their corruption-riddled countrys past while glorifying their own psychopathy, the men brazenly reenact their heinous crimes in a film-within-the-film, donning costumes and starring in flamboyant productions in which fact and fantasy queasily merge. Oppenheimer and his crewmany of whom must remain anonymous to ensure their safetyhave created an astonishing work.

(Mucednici lasky). Men in bowler hats running in unison down cobblestone streets, the curve of a womans leg, or a strange encounter between a working-class girl and a carriage-bound society swell: such are the strange visions of Nemecs Martys of Love, a three-part music-filled ballad to that most uncontrollable of all desires, unattainable love. Deemed subversive by government censors for focusing on inept, lovesick protagonists rather than striving communist heroes, Martyrs of Love steadfastly ignored Czech socialist reality to instead draw from the rich traditions of the Czech Surrealist Group, with scenes seemingly woven from dreams. Cinematography by the great New Wave icon Miroslav Ondrícek, who later fled to the U.S. and worked with Milos Forman on such films as Amadeus (screening 4.5.14) and Ragtime. It is cowritten and costume-designed by Ester Krumbachová, an important New Wave figure who also cowrote and costumed A Report on the Party and Guests, Jaromil Jires's Valerie and Her Week of Wonders, and Vera Chytilová's just-as-infamous Daisies, as well as many other works; she and Nemec were briefly married.

(Jana Aranya). ""Calcutta is love and hate with me,"" Satyajit Ray once commented. ""I have roots here. It can be a depressing place, but it's vital."" The Middleman, a black comedy, is a portrait of corruption born of chaos, and vice versa. Shot in the early days of Indira Gandhi's ""emergency rule,"" it describes a Calcutta of rampant unemployment, declining basic services (""we have three kinds of roads here: bad, very bad, and very very bad""), and politically inspired violence. Into this setting moves Ray's protagonist, Somnath Bannerji, a hopeful young man of good (Brahmin) breeding who finds himself desperately struggling to reach the top. But, this being Calcutta, Somnath reaches only the middle, and ""middleman"" is Bengali slang for ""pimp."" Penelope Huston commented, ""The Middleman is urbane, genial, so observantly funny in its detail and so sympathetically engaged...that its fundamental pessimism...becomes the more melancholy and impressive.""

Looks and sounds like no other documentary in memory.Dennis Lim, New York Times

A thrilling adventure both on the high seas and in documentary storytelling, Leviathan immerses viewers in the waterlogged toil of fishermen off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts, the setting of Melvilles Moby Dick. While neither the novels white whale nor the titular sea monster of biblical lore appear in this singular work of experimental ethnography, formidable creatures of nature and totalitarian forces of industry nonetheless haunt the North Atlantic trawler on which nameless workers battle the elements. Utilizing a passel of portable video cameras that are handed off from filmmaker to fisherman, sent sliding across the ships slippery deck, and tossed overboard into the deep blue depthsall to achieve a constantly shifting, disorienting point of view that repeatedly rolls and roils into gorgeous abstractioncodirectors Lucien Castaing-Taylor (Sweetgrass) and Veréna Paravel (Foreign Parts, SFIFF 2011) eschew standard doc aesthetics and withhold telltale details in favor of pure aquatic sensation. Remarkable sound designa heavy-metal mix of clanging machinery, moaning pipes, indecipherable utterances, and the ceaseless swirl of stormy seasfurther enhances this existential sojourn into the dead of night and the plight of labor.

If you needed an actor exuding marred innocence, River Phoenix could go with the flow. At age twenty, hed already tapped deep currents of fragile and aqueous angst. Phoenix plays Mike, a young street kid whose narcoleptic episodes are like a disappearing act. He psychically zones out of the dreary encounters that mark the search for his long-gone mom. Keanu Reeves, a disaffected joyboy, tags along for the raunchy ride that takes them from Portland to points east. Gus Van Sants melancholic portrait of bisexual street hustlers has tragedy written all over it, like the John Rechy novel, City of Night, that first shed its darkness on him.

Nemec returns to the Prague Spring and his own Oratorio for Prague with this oblique look at memory, love, and politics. Speaking over and interrupting footage from his remarkable 1969 documentary, Nemec inserts the personal into the political, describing his own actions and thwarted love affairs as Soviet tanks moved to occupy his nation. Here, history is not only the fall of governments and military actions, but a woman, the men who love her, and a desperate dash across the border to keep the documentary footage from being destroyed to ensure the world sees the invasion. Nemecs love affair may have faded, but his pictures remain.
