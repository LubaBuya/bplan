A Reassessment of Hebbian Mechanisms in Visual System Development by in vivo Imaging,Seminar: Oxyopia Seminar,2014-03-03T11:00:00,2014-03-03T12:30:00,489 Minor Hall,"Edward S. Ruthazer, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University","Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","I n 1949 Donald Hebb put forth an influential model proposing that learning may be manifested by a growth process between neuronal partners in the brain that exhibited correlated firing such that the presynaptic cell had participated in causing its postsynaptic partner to fire. The NMDA receptor has been identified as a molecular detector of correlated firing due to its voltage-dependence. Developmental refinement of neuronal circuits is also thought to exploit similar correlation-dependent mechanisms. Consistent with this idea, numerous studies have shown that NMDA receptor blockade or genetic knockout disrupts normal developmental plasticity and circuit refinement. Using a combination of targeted genetic manipulation, and time lapse imaging of axonal remodeling in response to patterned visual stimuli in vivo, we explore the contributions of correlated firing and NMDA receptors in the Xenopus retinotectal system, a classic experimental model for the study of activity-dependent visual system refinement.",Neuroscience

Plasticity of binocularity and acuity are differentially limited by Nogo Receptor,Seminar: Oxyopia Seminar,2014-03-10T11:00:00,2014-03-10T12:30:00,489 Minor Hall,"Aaron McGee, USC","Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Why does discordant vision only during childhood induce amblyopia (lazy-eye)? Why does this disorder cause enduring visual impairment even if the underlying causes are corrected in adulthood? This is in part because experience-dependent plasticity is limited in the maturing brain by factors present in the neuropil, including myelination and the extracellular matrix. The neuronal Nogo receptor (NgR1) gene is required to close the critical period for visual plasticity. Mice lacking this gene retain developmental visual plasticity as adults and spontaneously recover normal visual acuity in a rodent model of amblyopia. We are investigating how NgR1 restricts visual plasticity with a combination of mouse genetics, electrophysiology, chronic in vivo imaging, and behavioral assays. Our preliminary result reveal that although eye dominance and acuity are both impaired by abnormal vision, the plasticity of these facets of visual function may rely on distinct cortical circuitry",Neuroscience
