A Reassessment of Hebbian Mechanisms in Visual System Development by in vivo Imaging,Seminar: Oxyopia Seminar,2014-03-03T11:00:00,2014-03-03T12:30:00,489 Minor Hall,"Edward S. Ruthazer, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University","Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","I n 1949 Donald Hebb put forth an influential model proposing that learning may be manifested by a growth process between neuronal partners in the brain that exhibited correlated firing such that the presynaptic cell had participated in causing its postsynaptic partner to fire. The NMDA receptor has been identified as a molecular detector of correlated firing due to its voltage-dependence. Developmental refinement of neuronal circuits is also thought to exploit similar correlation-dependent mechanisms. Consistent with this idea, numerous studies have shown that NMDA receptor blockade or genetic knockout disrupts normal developmental plasticity and circuit refinement. Using a combination of targeted genetic manipulation, and time lapse imaging of axonal remodeling in response to patterned visual stimuli in vivo, we explore the contributions of correlated firing and NMDA receptors in the Xenopus retinotectal system, a classic experimental model for the study of activity-dependent visual system refinement.",Neuroscience

Plasticity of binocularity and acuity are differentially limited by Nogo Receptor,Seminar: Oxyopia Seminar,2014-03-10T11:00:00,2014-03-10T12:30:00,489 Minor Hall,"Aaron McGee, USC","Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Why does discordant vision only during childhood induce amblyopia (lazy-eye)? Why does this disorder cause enduring visual impairment even if the underlying causes are corrected in adulthood? This is in part because experience-dependent plasticity is limited in the maturing brain by factors present in the neuropil, including myelination and the extracellular matrix. The neuronal Nogo receptor (NgR1) gene is required to close the critical period for visual plasticity. Mice lacking this gene retain developmental visual plasticity as adults and spontaneously recover normal visual acuity in a rodent model of amblyopia. We are investigating how NgR1 restricts visual plasticity with a combination of mouse genetics, electrophysiology, chronic in vivo imaging, and behavioral assays. Our preliminary result reveal that although eye dominance and acuity are both impaired by abnormal vision, the plasticity of these facets of visual function may rely on distinct cortical circuitry",Neuroscience

Circuit defects in the neocortex of Fmr1 knockout mice,Seminar: Redwood Seminar,2014-03-12T12:00:00,2014-03-12T13:30:00,560 Evans Hall,"Carlos Portera-Cailliau, UCLA","Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Subtle alterations in how cortical network dynamics are modulated by different behavioral states could disrupt normal brain function and underlie symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders, including fragile X syndrome (FXS). Using two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology we recorded spontaneous neuronal ensemble activity in mouse somatosensory cortex. We find that unanesthetized Fmr1/ mice exhibit abnormally high synchrony of neocortical network activity. Neuronal firing rates are also 3-fold higher in Fmr1/ mice when the animals are in slow wave sleep or quiet wakefulness. Combined EEG/calcium imaging experiments confirmed that neurons in mutant mice have abnormally high firing and synchrony during sleep/rest. We conclude that cortical networks in FXS are hyperexcitable in a brain state-dependent manner during a critical period for experience-dependent plasticity. These state-dependent network defects could explain the intellectual, sleep and sensory integration dysfunctions associated with FXS.",Neuroscience

As a result, we have learned answers to questions such as ""Are the neural encodings of word meaning the same in your brain and mine?"", ""Are neural encodings of word meaning built out of recognizable subcomponents, or are they randomly different for each word?,"" and ""What sequence of neurally encoded information flows through the brain during the half-second in which the brain comprehends a word?""

Large-scale data has potential to transform almost every aspect of our world, from science to business; for this potential to be realized, we must turn data into insight. In this talk, I will describe two of my efforts to address this problem computationally: The first project, Metro Maps of Information, aims to help people understand the underlying structure of complex topics, such as news stories or research areas. Metro Maps are structured summaries that can help us understand the information landscape, connect the dots between pieces of information, and uncover the big picture. The second project proposes a framework for automatic discovery of insightful connections in data. In particular, we focus on identifying gaps in medical knowledge: our system recommends directions of research that are both novel and promising. I will formulate both problems mathematically and provide efficient, scalable methods for solving them.

Our framework, concise comparative summarization (CCS), is built on sparse classification methods. It is a lightweight and flexible tool that offers a compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently in wide use and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We argue that sparse methods have much to offer for text analysis and hope CCS opens the door for a new branch of research in this important field. Using news articles from the New York Times, we validate our tool by designing and conducting a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human understanding. We demonstrate our approach with two case studies, a media analysis of the framing of Egypt in the New York Times throughout the Arab Spring and an informal comparison of the New York Times and Wall Street Journals coverage of energy. Overall, we find that the Lasso with L2 normalization can be effectively and usefully used to summarize large corpora, regardless of document size. Finally, I will present preliminary results in an on-going project to study the opinions of U.S. courts of appeal by using CCS in combination with LDA.",EECS

Where and how the brain visually encodes 3D object orientation remains unknown, but prior studies suggest the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) may be involved. Here, we develop rigorous analytical methods for quantifying 3D orientation tuning curves, and use these tools to the study the neural coding of surface orientation. Specifically, we show that single neurons in area CIP of the rhesus macaque jointly encode the slant and tilt of a planar surface, and that across the population, the distribution of preferred slant-tilts is not statistically different from uniform. This suggests that all slant-tilt combinations are equally represented in area CIP. Furthermore, some CIP neurons are found to also represent the third rotational degree of freedom that determines the orientation of the image pattern on the planar surface. Together, the present results suggest that CIP is a critical neural locus for the encoding of all three rotational degrees of freedom specifying an objects 3D spatial orientation.

We investigate the complex and polymorphic subject of trust in these distributed systems and describe a new framework using multiple partially ordered semirings for analyzing reputation and trust establishment, dynamics as well as composite trust. This framework is inspired by thinking of trust problems as path problems in networks. Next we describe our work based on constrained coalitional games towards understanding the role of trust in collaboration and social networks. We describe several specific applications of these methods in securing distributed inference systems, sensor networks for power grids, wireless network routing protocols, distributed control systems.

Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes. Noninvasive techniques to measure internal mechanical properties will be discussed. Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion. One approach to biological repair strategies that will be discussed is to cultivate engineered tissue in vitro, permitting some elaboration of extracellular matrix for improved long-term outcome following in vivo implantation.",EECS
Building systems that compute on encrypted data,Lecture: Departmental,2014-03-10T13:00:00,2014-03-10T14:00:00,"Soda Hall, 430-438 (Wozniak Lounge)","RALUCA POPA, MIT",Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS),"Theft of confidential data is prevalent. In most applications, confidential data is stored at servers. Thus, existing systems naturally try to prevent adversaries from compromising these servers. However, experience has shown that adversaries still find a way to break in and steal the data. In this talk, I will describe a new approach to protecting data confidentiality even when attackers get access to all server data: building practical systems that compute on encrypted data without access to the decryption key. In this setting, I designed and built a database system (CryptDB), a web application platform (Mylar), and two mobile systems, as well as developed new cryptographic schemes for them. I showed that these systems support a wide range of applications with low overhead. The talk will focus primarily on CryptDB and Mylar. My work has already had impact: Google uses CryptDBs design for their new Encrypted BigQuery service, and a medical application of Bostons Newton-Wellesley hospital is secured with Mylar. Looking forward, this approach promises to solve confidentiality problems in other settings, such as big data systems, genomics processing, and machine learning over sensitive data.",EECS

We show that this substitution of (approximately) equals for equals is safe in the sense that the approximation error between sodium-channel models does not get amplified by the feed-back-loop context in which it is placed. To prove this feed-back compositionality result, we exhibit quadratic-polynomial, exponentially decaying bisimulation functions between the IMW and HH-type sodium channels, and also for the IMW-based context in which these sodium-channel models are placed. These functions allow us to quantify the overall error introduced by the sodium-channel abstraction and subsequent substitution in the IMW model. To automate the computation of the bisimulation functions, we employ the SOSTOOLS optimization toolbox. Our experimental results validate our analytical findings.

Although mHealth devices and applications are proliferating, many challenges remain to provide the necessary usability, manageability, interoperability, availability, security, and privacy. The vision of the Amulet project is that computational jewelry, in a form like a bracelet or pendant, will provide the properties essential for successful body-area mHealth networks. These devices coordinate the activity of the body-area network and provide a discreet means for communicating with their wearer. Such devices complement the capabilities of a smartphone, bridging the gap between the type of pervasive computing possible with a mobile phone and that enabled by wearable computing. Our interdisciplinary team of investigators is designing and developing Amulet, an electronic bracelet and a software framework that enables developers to create (and users to easily use) safe, secure, and efficient mHealth applications that fit seamlessly into everyday life. The research is determining the degree to which computational jewelry offers advantages in availability, reliability, security, privacy, and usability, and developing techniques that provide these properties in spite of the severely-constrained power resources of wearable jewelry.

These three-dimensional conjugates consist of densely functionalized, highly oriented nucleic acids covalently attached to the surface of inorganic nanoparticles. The strength and length of the programmable DNA bonds between these structures can be adjusted by varying DNA sequence and length, and the properties of the atoms can be adjusted by varying nanoparticle size, shape, and composition.

There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system. A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy. We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. The assay complements current genetic characterizations of tumor variation between individuals and should greatly speed up the testing of new drugs in research settings.

Engineering Biological Cell Access: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-04-11T14:00:00,2014-04-11T15:00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,"Prof. Nicholas A. Melosh, Stanford University, Materials Science & Engineering",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The cell membrane is one of the most vital components of a cell; the gate-keeper into and out of the cytoplasm. Studies ranging from neural activity to drug discovery to fundamental cell physiology rely upon controlling electronic or chemical flow across this barrier. Unfortunately, our ability to artificially control cellular access is surprisingly poor; current techniques often involve creating holes in or puncturing cell membranes that often cause rapid cell death. Yet precise, non-destructive access to the cell interior can lead to an impressive range of new techniques and devices, ranging from neural-prosthetic interfaces, electrical cell monitoring for disease, to rapid drug screening. These types of technologies are particularly important for the recently announced Brain Activity Map and for harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells as disease models and clinical indicators. One of the critical problems is that we have little knowledge of what happens when the lipid membrane interacts with cell-penetrating materials. Here we explore how inorganic materials with nanoscale molecular functionalization influence and control this vital interface. We discovered that by selectively tuning the hydrophobicity and flexibility of the molecular functionalization we can replicate many of the design features of natural transmembrane proteins, providing non-disruptive mechanical, electrical and chemical access into the cell. These Stealth probes spontaneously insert into lipid membrane, and form tight lipid-post junctions. Force testing with atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of interfacial adhesion, which surprisingly reveals significant adhesion energy differences between molecular groups with similar hydrophobicity but different mobility. This contradicts traditional hydrophobicity indices as indicators of molecular stability in lipid membranes. Similarly, we achieved high-efficiency chemical delivery and control by mimicking nature gap junction proteins to create nanostraw arrays. These nanoscale (100-500 nm) diameter straws are formed based on simple water filtration membranes, and spontaneously penetrate cells plated onto them. We find these provide permanent conduits into cells, permitting delivery of a wide variety of materials that could normally not pass through the cell wall. These two technologies are examples of how the combination of physical sciences and biology can create new beneficial devices that would not be possible in isolation.",EECS

We analyze our model from three perspectives: waiting, optimization, and information. The main insight of our analysis is that waiting to thicken the market can be substantially more important than increasing the speed of transactions, and this is quite robust to the presence of waiting costs. From an optimization perspective, naive local algorithms, that choose the right time to match agents but do not exploit global network structure, can perform very close to optimal algorithms. From an information perspective, algorithms that employ even partial information on agents' departure times perform substantially better than those that lack such information. To elicit agents' departure times, we design an incentive-compatible continuous-time dynamic mechanism without transfers.",EECS

One approach to harvesting the energy is to carry out light-powered chemical reactions. Thermodynamically uphill, these reactions produce energetic chemicals that can be used as fuels, promising a large-scale energy storage solution. To enable these reactions, we need materials that can absorb light, separate charges, and catalyze specific chemistries. The materials should be made of earth-abundant elements to allow for large-scale implementations. They also need to be resistant against photo corrosion. To date, a low-cost, long-lasting material that can produce solar fuels with a high efficiency remains elusive. In this talk, we present our efforts aimed at understanding what limits the performance of materials in solar fuel generation reactions. Within the context of photoanode and photocathode, we show how the photoelectrode properties are changed by introducing material components designed for improving charge transport, surface potential accumulation, and interface kinetics, respectively. We also demonstrate that highly complex organic molecules can be produced by photoreduction of CO2, in a fashion closely mimicking the dark reactions in natural photosynthesis. This body of work is enabled by our ability to synthesize materials with precisely controlled surfaces and interfaces using methods such as atomic layer deposition. Our results highlight the importance of understanding thermodynamic and kinetic factors in complex systems such as that for solar fuel production separately.

In this talk, I will provide an overview our ongoing efforts to design lead salt QD thin film absorbers for next-generation PV. Basic requirements for QD absorber layers include efficient light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, and long-term stability. I will first discuss several methods used to make conductive QD films by solution deposition and ligand exchange. Studies of carrier mobility as a function of basic film parameters such as inter-QD spacing, QD size, and QD size distribution have led to a better understanding of charge transport within highly disordered QD films. Efforts to improve carrier mobility by enhancing inter-dot electronic coupling, passivating surface states, and implementing rudimentary doping will be highlighted. Engineering the inter-QD matrix to produce QD/inorganic or QD/organic nanocomposites is introduced as a promising way to optimize coupling, remove surface states, and achieve long-term environmental stability for high-performance, robust QD films. To obtain large photocurrent from QD solar cells, it is critical to increase the minority carrier diffusion length to rival the optical absorption length, possibly by harnessing band-like transport through extended electronic states. The relative roles of superlattice order, energy disorder, and surface states in this regard will be summarized. The talk will conclude with comments on the prospects for controlled doping and rational p-n junction formation in QD systems.",EECS

The NMDA receptor has been identified as a molecular detector of correlated firing due to its voltage-dependence. Developmental refinement of neuronal circuits is also thought to exploit similar correlation-dependent mechanisms. Consistent with this idea, numerous studies have shown that NMDA receptor blockade or genetic knockout disrupts normal developmental plasticity and circuit refinement. Using a combination of targeted genetic manipulation, and time lapse imaging of axonal remodeling in response to patterned visual stimuli in vivo, we explore the contributions of correlated firing and NMDA receptors in the Xenopus retinotectal system, a classic experimental model for the study of activity-dependent visual system refinement.",BioE

Flanagan Associate Professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University Stem cells offer tremendous promise as the basis of regenerative therapies due to their inherent capacity for differentiation into various cell types and their potent ability to secrete a unique cadre of morphogenic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory factors. Engineering the properties of 3D stem cell microenvironments offers a means of regulating their fate and function in an analogous format to the multicellular organization of primitive developing tissues. Simple multicellular aggregates of stem cells permit differentiation and morphogenesis of complex tissue structures, as demonstrated by numerous recent organoid examples, and are directly amenable to scalable suspension culture techniques. Thus, we have taken a systematic approach to the engineering of pluripotent and multipotent stem cell aggregates in order to examine the effects of biophysical and biochemical cues on cell fate, morphogenesis, and secretory function for the purposes of creating in vitro model systems, developing scalable biomanufacturing technologies, and directing innate trophic delivery and regenerative potential. We have demonstrated through a series of studies that hydrodynamic forces created within mixed suspension culture can modulate differentiation and extracellular matrix and growth factor expression of homogeneous populations of pluripotent stem cell aggregates. We have also pioneered the incorporation of different types of biomaterials within 3D aggregates of stem cells as a means of spatiotemporally controlling the delivery of exogenous factors and sequestering of endogenous morphogens that impact stem cell phenotype. More recently we have developed quantitative analytical methods and computational modeling approaches to assess the cellular composition, mechanical properties and patterns of differentiation within single aggregates to complement our experimental efforts to dissect the mechanisms regulating stem cell fate decisions. The sum of these strategies is intended to enhance our understanding of the governing principles dictating stem cell morphogenesis and ultimately translate the potential of stem cells into viable cell-based therapies and diagnostics that transform the future of biomedical research and healthcare practices.

The intervertebral disc is comprised of mechanically and structurally unique substructures including the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus, which function together to support and absorb spinal loads. Disc degeneration occurs as early as the second decade of life and contributes to over $130 billion in medical costs. Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes. Noninvasive techniques to measure internal mechanical properties will be discussed. Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion. One approach to biological repair strategies that will be discussed is to cultivate engineered tissue in vitro, permitting some elaboration of extracellular matrix for improved long-term outcome following in vivo implantation.",BioE
Plasticity of binocularity and acuity are differentially limited by Nogo Receptor,Seminar: Seminars of interest,2014-03-10T11:00:00,2014-03-10T12:30:00,489 Minor Hall,"Aaron McGee, USC","Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Why does discordant vision only during childhood induce amblyopia (lazy-eye)? Why does this disorder cause enduring visual impairment even if the underlying causes are corrected in adulthood? This is in part because experience-dependent plasticity is limited in the maturing brain by factors present in the neuropil, including myelination and the extracellular matrix. The neuronal Nogo receptor (NgR1) gene is required to close the critical period for visual plasticity. Mice lacking this gene retain developmental visual plasticity as adults and spontaneously recover normal visual acuity in a rodent model of amblyopia. We are investigating how NgR1 restricts visual plasticity with a combination of mouse genetics, electrophysiology, chronic in vivo imaging, and behavioral assays. Our preliminary result reveal that although eye dominance and acuity are both impaired by abnormal vision, the plasticity of these facets of visual function may rely on distinct cortical circuitry",BioE

K. Lashmet Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute This talk will describe our efforts to interface bioactive molecules with nanomaterials and nanoscale scaffolds for designing potent therapeutics and functional nanocomposites. The design of polyvalent molecules presenting multiple copies of a specific ligand represents a promising strategy to inhibit pathogens and bacterial toxins. We will first describe the design of polyvalent inhibitors that are orders of magnitude more active than the corresponding monovalent molecules and can neutralize anthrax toxin in vivo. We recently described a thermodynamic analysis to help clarify the theoretical basis for the large enhancements in avidity due to polyvalency. We have used this understanding to guide the structure-based design of potent synthetic polyvalent ligands. The ability to control independently the valency and the spacing between ligands is particularly valuable for these design efforts. To that end, we recently designed monodisperse polypeptide-based polyvalent inhibitors of anthrax toxin in which multiple copies of an inhibitory toxin-binding peptide were separated by flexible peptide linkers. By tuning the valency and linker length, we designed polyvalent inhibitors that were over four orders of magnitude more potent than the corresponding monovalent ligands. Studies relating the composition and structure of polyvalent inhibitors to their activity have also shed light on fundamental aspects of polyvalent recognition, including the role of pattern matching. We will also discuss other applications of polyvalent molecules ranging from the inhibition of pathogens (e.g., the influenza virus) to controlling the nanoscale organization of cellular receptors to regulate signaling and stem cell fate. In addition to the inhibition of bacterial toxins, we are also investigating approaches to target pathogenic bacteria. In particular, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has been a growing concern. We have been exploring an enzyme-based approach to combat pathogenic bacteria. We will describe an approach that we have developed to identify novel bacteriolytic enzymes targeting a variety of bacterial pathogens. We have also investigated the structure and function of these and other enzymes when immobilized onto nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes. Our studies indicate that the nanoscale environment can significantly influence the activity and stability of these proteins. We have used the highly stable and active nanomaterial-protein conjugates to form nanocomposite films that are effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).

We have demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) as artificial atoms in nanoparticle superlattice assemblies. These three-dimensional conjugates consist of densely functionalized, highly oriented nucleic acids covalently attached to the surface of inorganic nanoparticles. The strength and length of the programmable DNA bonds between these structures can be adjusted by varying DNA sequence and length, and the properties of the atoms can be adjusted by varying nanoparticle size, shape, and composition. We have developed design rules for this assembly process, analogous to Paulings Rules for ionic solids but ultimately more powerful.

There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system. A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy. We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. The assay complements current genetic characterizations of tumor variation between individuals and should greatly speed up the testing of new drugs in research settings.

Melosh, Stanford University, Materials Science & Engineering",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The cell membrane is one of the most vital components of a cell; the gate-keeper into and out of the cytoplasm. Studies ranging from neural activity to drug discovery to fundamental cell physiology rely upon controlling electronic or chemical flow across this barrier. Unfortunately, our ability to artificially control cellular access is surprisingly poor; current techniques often involve creating holes in or puncturing cell membranes that often cause rapid cell death. Yet precise, non-destructive access to the cell interior can lead to an impressive range of new techniques and devices, ranging from neural-prosthetic interfaces, electrical cell monitoring for disease, to rapid drug screening. These types of technologies are particularly important for the recently announced Brain Activity Map and for harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells as disease models and clinical indicators. One of the critical problems is that we have little knowledge of what happens when the lipid membrane interacts with cell-penetrating materials. Here we explore how inorganic materials with nanoscale molecular functionalization influence and control this vital interface. We discovered that by selectively tuning the hydrophobicity and flexibility of the molecular functionalization we can replicate many of the design features of natural transmembrane proteins, providing non-disruptive mechanical, electrical and chemical access into the cell. These Stealth probes spontaneously insert into lipid membrane, and form tight lipid-post junctions. Force testing with atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of interfacial adhesion, which surprisingly reveals significant adhesion energy differences between molecular groups with similar hydrophobicity but different mobility. This contradicts traditional hydrophobicity indices as indicators of molecular stability in lipid membranes. Similarly, we achieved high-efficiency chemical delivery and control by mimicking nature gap junction proteins to create nanostraw arrays. These nanoscale (100-500 nm) diameter straws are formed based on simple water filtration membranes, and spontaneously penetrate cells plated onto them. We find these provide permanent conduits into cells, permitting delivery of a wide variety of materials that could normally not pass through the cell wall. These two technologies are examples of how the combination of physical sciences and biology can create new beneficial devices that would not be possible in isolation.",BioE

One approach to harvesting the energy is to carry out light-powered chemical reactions. Thermodynamically uphill, these reactions produce energetic chemicals that can be used as fuels, promising a large-scale energy storage solution. To enable these reactions, we need materials that can absorb light, separate charges, and catalyze specific chemistries. The materials should be made of earth-abundant elements to allow for large-scale implementations. They also need to be resistant against photo corrosion. To date, a low-cost, long-lasting material that can produce solar fuels with a high efficiency remains elusive. In this talk, we present our efforts aimed at understanding what limits the performance of materials in solar fuel generation reactions. Within the context of photoanode and photocathode, we show how the photoelectrode properties are changed by introducing material components designed for improving charge transport, surface potential accumulation, and interface kinetics, respectively. We also demonstrate that highly complex organic molecules can be produced by photoreduction of CO2, in a fashion closely mimicking the dark reactions in natural photosynthesis. This body of work is enabled by our ability to synthesize materials with precisely controlled surfaces and interfaces using methods such as atomic layer deposition. Our results highlight the importance of understanding thermodynamic and kinetic factors in complex systems such as that for solar fuel production separately.

In this talk, I will provide an overview our ongoing efforts to design lead salt QD thin film absorbers for next-generation PV. Basic requirements for QD absorber layers include efficient light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, and long-term stability. I will first discuss several methods used to make conductive QD films by solution deposition and ligand exchange. Studies of carrier mobility as a function of basic film parameters such as inter-QD spacing, QD size, and QD size distribution have led to a better understanding of charge transport within highly disordered QD films. Efforts to improve carrier mobility by enhancing inter-dot electronic coupling, passivating surface states, and implementing rudimentary doping will be highlighted. Engineering the inter-QD matrix to produce QD/inorganic or QD/organic nanocomposites is introduced as a promising way to optimize coupling, remove surface states, and achieve long-term environmental stability for high-performance, robust QD films. To obtain large photocurrent from QD solar cells, it is critical to increase the minority carrier diffusion length to rival the optical absorption length, possibly by harnessing band-like transport through extended electronic states. The relative roles of superlattice order, energy disorder, and surface states in this regard will be summarized. The talk will conclude with comments on the prospects for controlled doping and rational p-n junction formation in QD systems.",BioE

Our framework, concise comparative summarization (CCS), is built on sparse classification methods. It is a lightweight and flexible tool that offers a compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently in wide use and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We argue that sparse methods have much to offer for text analysis and hope CCS opens the door for a new branch of research in this important field. Using news articles from the New York Times, we validate our tool by designing and conducting a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human understanding. We demonstrate our approach with two case studies, a media analysis of the framing of Egypt in the New York Times throughout the Arab Spring and an informal comparison of the New York Times and Wall Street Journals coverage of energy. Overall, we find that the Lasso with L2 normalization can be effectively and usefully used to summarize large corpora, regardless of document size.

More remarkably, these strategies are produced as solutions of Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem on the multidimensional unit simplex with a cost function that can be described as the log partition function.

The CDF of the rescaled process conditioned on survival has a nondegenerate limit if and only if the branching mechanism is regularly at $0$.

Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes.

Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion.

Nix, Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University",Materials Science and Engineering (MSE),"Understanding the insertion of lithium into silicon electrodes for high capacity lithium-ion batteries is likely to have benefits for mobile energy storage, for both electronics and transportation. Silicon nanostructures have proven to be attractive candidates for electrodes because they provide less constraint on the volume changes that occur and more resistance to fracture during lithium insertion. But still, facture can occur even in nanostructured silicon. Here, we consider the fracture of Si nanopillars during lithiation and find surprising results. We find that fracture is initiated at the surfaces of the crystalline nanopillars and not in the interior, as had been predicted by analyses based on diffusion-induced stresses. In situ transmission electron microscopy observations of initially crystalline Si nanoparticles shows that lithiation occurs by the growth of an amorphous lithiated shell, subjected to tension, at the expense of a crystalline Si core, subjected to compression. We also show that the expansion of the nanopillars is highly anisotropic and that the fracture locations are also anisotropic. In addition, we find a critical fracture diameter for initially crystalline nanopillars of about 300nm that appears to depend on the electrochemical reaction rate. Modeling the stress evolution in Si nanopillars during lithiation provides a way to understand and control these failure processes. Also, we show that initially amorphous Si nanopillars are much more resistant to failure, having much larger critical fracture diameters, because the initial stresses at the surface are compressive in this situation compared to tension in the case of initially crystalline nanopillars. For sufficiently big amorphous Si nanopillars, cracking is expected to be initiated in the interior based on diffusion-induced stresses, but we have not yet observed this kind of fracture. The modeling we, and others, have done has been based largely on estimates or guesses about the mechanical properties of lithiated Si. Recent nanoindentation experiments show that the elastic modulus and hardness of lithiated amorphous Si depend strongly on the lithium content and also show very significant creep effects. These more subtle effects may need to be included in future modeling. It is hoped that these studies will be useful in the design of silicon electrodes for advanced battery systems.

There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system. A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy. We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy.

Melosh, Stanford University, Materials Science & Engineering",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The cell membrane is one of the most vital components of a cell; the gate-keeper into and out of the cytoplasm. Studies ranging from neural activity to drug discovery to fundamental cell physiology rely upon controlling electronic or chemical flow across this barrier. Unfortunately, our ability to artificially control cellular access is surprisingly poor; current techniques often involve creating holes in or puncturing cell membranes that often cause rapid cell death. Yet precise, non-destructive access to the cell interior can lead to an impressive range of new techniques and devices, ranging from neural-prosthetic interfaces, electrical cell monitoring for disease, to rapid drug screening. These types of technologies are particularly important for the recently announced Brain Activity Map and for harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells as disease models and clinical indicators. One of the critical problems is that we have little knowledge of what happens when the lipid membrane interacts with cell-penetrating materials. Here we explore how inorganic materials with nanoscale molecular functionalization influence and control this vital interface. We discovered that by selectively tuning the hydrophobicity and flexibility of the molecular functionalization we can replicate many of the design features of natural transmembrane proteins, providing non-disruptive mechanical, electrical and chemical access into the cell. These Stealth probes spontaneously insert into lipid membrane, and form tight lipid-post junctions. Force testing with atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of interfacial adhesion, which surprisingly reveals significant adhesion energy differences between molecular groups with similar hydrophobicity but different mobility. This contradicts traditional hydrophobicity indices as indicators of molecular stability in lipid membranes. Similarly, we achieved high-efficiency chemical delivery and control by mimicking nature gap junction proteins to create nanostraw arrays. These nanoscale (100-500 nm) diameter straws are formed based on simple water filtration membranes, and spontaneously penetrate cells plated onto them. We find these provide permanent conduits into cells, permitting delivery of a wide variety of materials that could normally not pass through the cell wall. These two technologies are examples of how the combination of physical sciences and biology can create new beneficial devices that would not be possible in isolation.",Nanosciences

One approach to harvesting the energy is to carry out light-powered chemical reactions. Thermodynamically uphill, these reactions produce energetic chemicals that can be used as fuels, promising a large-scale energy storage solution. To enable these reactions, we need materials that can absorb light, separate charges, and catalyze specific chemistries. The materials should be made of earth-abundant elements to allow for large-scale implementations. They also need to be resistant against photo corrosion. To date, a low-cost, long-lasting material that can produce solar fuels with a high efficiency remains elusive. In this talk, we present our efforts aimed at understanding what limits the performance of materials in solar fuel generation reactions. Within the context of photoanode and photocathode, we show how the photoelectrode properties are changed by introducing material components designed for improving charge transport, surface potential accumulation, and interface kinetics, respectively. We also demonstrate that highly complex organic molecules can be produced by photoreduction of CO2, in a fashion closely mimicking the dark reactions in natural photosynthesis. This body of work is enabled by our ability to synthesize materials with precisely controlled surfaces and interfaces using methods such as atomic layer deposition. Our results highlight the importance of understanding thermodynamic and kinetic factors in complex systems such as that for solar fuel production separately.

Efforts to improve carrier mobility by enhancing inter-dot electronic coupling, passivating surface states, and implementing rudimentary doping will be highlighted. Engineering the inter-QD matrix to produce QD/inorganic or QD/organic nanocomposites is introduced as a promising way to optimize coupling, remove surface states, and achieve long-term environmental stability for high-performance, robust QD films. To obtain large photocurrent from QD solar cells, it is critical to increase the minority carrier diffusion length to rival the optical absorption length, possibly by harnessing band-like transport through extended electronic states. The relative roles of superlattice order, energy disorder, and surface states in this regard will be summarized. The talk will conclude with comments on the prospects for controlled doping and rational p-n junction formation in QD systems.",Nanosciences

The main insight of our analysis is that waiting to thicken the market can be substantially more important than increasing the speed of transactions, and this is quite robust to the presence of waiting costs. From an optimization perspective, naive local algorithms, that choose the right time to match agents but do not exploit global network structure, can perform very close to optimal algorithms. From an information perspective, algorithms that employ even partial information on agents' departure times perform substantially better than those that lack such information. To elicit agents' departure times, we design an incentive-compatible continuous-time dynamic mechanism without transfers.",Economics

First, we consider a field experiment conducted by Sweden's monopoly alcohol retailer and find that moving purchases from behind the counter to self-service disproportionately increases the sales of difficult-to-to-pronounce products. Second, we use individual-level panel data from a pizza delivery restaurant to show that online orders have more complexity, calories, and diversity, and measure the consequences for consumer and producer surplus.

The subsequent aftershocks, fires, and ensuing panic bred rumors that malcontent Koreans living in Japan were setting the fires, poisoning water wells, and plotting a revolution. To prevent this alleged uprising, vigilantes along with police and the military massacred more than 6,000 Koreans. Partly to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the massacre, two unreleased rare documentaries from Japan have been touring the United States since last September. The films feature interviews with Japanese and Korean survivors, and the first of the two sequel films ""Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans From the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo, 1923 will be shown. The movie was directed by Choonkong Oh, a Korean resident of Japan, and is in Japanese and Korean with English subtitles. The documentary is under an hour long, and will be followed by a discussion featuring Jinhee Lee, a history professor at Eastern Illinois University whose research focuses on the competing narratives of collective violence in the Japanese empire.",Student Events

Angela Garcias work engages historical and institutional processes through which violence and suffering is produced and lived. A central theme is the disproportionate burden of addiction, depression and incarceration among poor families and communities. Professor Garcias book, The Pastoral Clinic: Addiction and Dispossession Along The Rio Grande (University of California Press, 2010) received the 2012 Victor Turner Prize and a 2010 Pen Center USA Award. The Pastoral Clinic explores the relationship between intergenerational heroin use, poverty and colonial history in northern New Mexico. Ongoing work in the U.S. explores processes of legal re-entry and intimate repair that incarcerated and paroled drug users undertake, particularly within kin networks.

Our goal is to raise awareness and inspire the Berkeley population to engage both themselves and their community in productive conversation and action. This year's theme is Building Bridges. The symposium has historically stood for a platform and voice for our homeless clients and friends to advocate for themselves and changes that need to be made in the Berkeley community as a whole. We anticipate an audience of 100 or more students and community members hoping to engage in homelessness and poverty action. We want to hold our public socially responsible to the marginalization that continues to occur. Our hope is that this symposium will push people to alter the circumstances that allow for poverty to persist. Though our focus for the week is on inequity, we're all taking a look at intersectionality. What are the ways in which poverty intersects with gender issues, or disaster relief? These are the kinds of dialogues we bring up at our Poverty Symposium and hope that you'll join us for an engaging discussion about why poverty persists today and what we as citizens can do about it!",Student Events

They attach to these ideas and beliefs, and they fight over them -- this only leads suffering. The word for that is ""ignorance"". Not only that, but through their intense desire, anger and ignorance, human beings are exterminating all life on this planet through a mindless pursuit of material comfort and temporary ease. If human beings do not soon ""wake up,"" they risk ending life for so many species of living things, not only themselves. ""Zen"" (meditation) means returning to the fundamental, true Self - which comes before nationality or religion. An American-born Zen monk and graduate of Yale and Harvard, Hyon Gak Sunim ordained as a monk in 1992. In his talk, he will stress that meditation is not based on religion, belief, or dogma. It is scientifically tested, peer-reviewed and affirmed technology for human beings to reach their innermost depths and most creative possibilities. As we well know, recent scientific studies have proven that meditation frees up creative forces, unleashes unconscious creativities, and generates non-sectarian bases for genuine fellow-feeling and modes of compassionate interaction. The explosive field of neuroplasticity itself proves that when human beings spend even just a few minutes a day, following their breath and noticing deeply their thought-patterns, they are subtly freed from entrapping patterns of thought and feeling. This talk will introduce to the public the basic teaching of Zen, and its central technology of looking into one's true nature.",Student Events

"After ""Assimilating Seoul"": Changgyŏng Garden and the Post-Colonial Remaking of Seouls Public Spaces",Colloquium,2014-05-02T16:00:00,2014-05-02T17:00:00,"Institute of East Asian Studies (2223 Fulton, 6th Floor), Conference Room","Todd A. Henry, Assistant Professor of History, UC San Diego",Center for Korean Studies (CKS),"The title of this talk is meant to signal two related topics for discussion. The first refers to my new book, ""Assimilating Seoul: Japanese Rule and The Politics of Public Space in Colonial Korea, 1910-1945"" (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2014). The introductory part of the talk reviews the central argument of that book  namely, that public space functioned as contact zones wherein varying projects of assimilation were both implanted by state officials and contested by their non-elite users. The second part of the talk extends this story beyond the liberation of 1945 and into the history of South Korea. In this context, the title refers to the project of recasting the capital city as a capitalist and anti-communist focus of post-colonial politics. After briefly examining the post-liberation strategy of erasure, the fate of Namsans Shintō Shrines, I turn to the more common strategy of decolonization, which involved creatively recycling the citys palace grounds before ultimately restoring them. To trace this decolonizing strategy, I explore the fate of Changgyŏng Garden, whose popular zoo, park, museum and other recreational facilities persisted long after 1945. Meanwhile, the early architects of South Korea creatively re-used this site for new national purposes, including to memorialize anti-communist patriots and to showcase the countrys infant industries. It was only over the next three decades that the overlapping functions of this public space were separated into distinct sites, each capable of carrying out a specific role in re-subjectifying the citizenry.",Student Events

When formalized, an apprenticeship often involved a ten-year indenture of a young boy or girl to a master or mistress. Unpaid labor was exchanged for entry into the mystery of the craft. The four conservatori or foundling homes of Naples were the first to institutionalize this indenture, ultimately aggregating as many as 600 boys for the intense study of music. Just as the four Inns of Court in London raised clerkship to a higher level in English law, so the conservatories of Naples created a critical mass of young talents such as Europe had never seen. By the end of the nineteenth century almost every industrializing nation had established its own version of a music conservatory. Perhaps the low social status of foundlings and performing musicians and their hermetic insiders praxis (a hold-over from the closed world of craft guilds) led educated writers on music to overlook or to deprecate the mindless repetitive exercises of the conservatories. Even when, at the Paris Conservatory, the work of replicating master patterns was raised to a level of finesse comparable to that of the École des Beaux-Arts, it was still not considered of any theoretical significance. Only from the mid-1990s did a small group of scholars begin to re-examine and rediscover what was being learned in the great conservatories. In modern terms, we can now recognize a systematic praxis aimed at the building up of a huge repertory of schemata or constructions, which collectively operated like what contemporary linguists term a usage-based grammar. The goal of such an undertaking would be to produce native speakers of a language, and the many great composers who emerged from this training would seem to support its efficacy.",Music

Music Studies Colloquium - Wong: Rereading Ethnomusicology for Gender and Erotics,Performing Arts - Music: Colloquium/Symposium/Conference: DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC,2014-04-07T16:30:00,2014-04-07T18:00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Deborah Wong, UC Riverside",Department of Music,"How and why did gender studies move so quickly through ethnomusicology, and then (mostly) disappear? Why has sexuality studies barely made any appearance at all, despite musics central role in shaping desire? Ethnomusicology moved to a post-gender stance with lightning speed. That is, after key publications about women/gender and music in the 1980s-90s, ethnomusicologists began to add the phrase and gender to their arguments but to a great extent stopped focusing on it. As Ellen Koskoff has written, after a brief spurt in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, work in feminist and genderist ethnomusicology seemed to slow in relation to that of musicology(Koskoff 2005, 90). I offer a reclamation model meant to dialogically regroup, recoup, and reformulate existing ethnomusicological scholarship. Attention to gendered orders of music is missing from much of our most treasured literature, and I aim to reread itto read it anew, to read it with new eyesnot in order to rescue it but to fold the gesture of critique into our work as I make visible the invisibility of gender in so much of our best scholarship. This is in some ways homage and in others an openly counterfactual history. I will reread my own book on Thai music by folding in current media coverage of spectacularly misogynistic demonstrations against the female Prime Minister. I will reread several key monographs by other ethnomusicologists to consider the range of acts available to usradical rereading, evocative/poetic rereading, mournful rereadingwhile arguing that this agentive feminist act of reading (refusing the apparent absence) is an extension of the gaze exerted by subalterns of many kinds in many places. I aim to activate a bifocal consciousness and to exert the black look articulated by bell hooks to theorize a reading method for ethnomusicologists that traces the ghostly presence of gender and erotics, reading around their apparent absence for their outlines and sonic traces. I will draw from the abundance of theories addressing the act of oppositional watching/listening and theories for rereading from philosophy and education, which emphasize how re-knowing and re-cognition is part of the rereading process. Can a second reading open up a third space? Neither a rescue operation nor an apologist celebration, this is instead a deeply necessary and respectful effort to reengage with (rather than disengage from) leading scholarship by ethnomusicologists that has mostly turned a blind eye toward gender and sexuality. I offer both a practical method and a theory of rereading drawn from feminist theory, minoritarian studies, and translation studies.",Music

We turn our backs on the waters that surround us to our great peril. For many years, experts of various stripes have been warning about the threat posed to the city by climate change-induced rising tides. In 1999, for example, the Environmental Defense Fund published a report titled Hot Nights in the City: Global Warming, Sea-Level Rise, and the New York Metropolitan Region. A decade later, MoMA and P.S.1 collaborated on a design competition, Rising Tides: Projects for New Yorks Waterfront, that was intended to explore innovative solutions to the citys heightened vulnerability to storm-surge induced inundation. Yet when Hurricane Sandy struck New York just over a year ago, the city seemed almost totally unprepared for the infrastructural and human emergencies provoked by this natural disaster. Numerous factors combined to make New York vulnerable to Sandy, but underlying them all was the fact that weve largely forgotten our citys links to its maritime environment. Since the spread of mass air transport, few of us travel long distances on the surface of the planets oceans. Even fewer of us actually depend directly on the sea for our livelihoods. In the words of the filmmaker Alan Sekula, the oceans have become the worlds forgotten space, an occult zone absolutely crucial to global economic exchange and yet almost totally elided from cultural representation. This is the story of how we forgot the sea. Ashley Dawson is Professor of English at the City University of New Yorks Graduate Center and at the College of Staten Island/CUNY. He is the author of the Routledge Concise History of Twentieth-Century British Literature (2013) and Mongrel Nation: Diasporic Culture and the Making of Postcolonial Britain (Michigan, 2007), and co-editor of three essay collections: Democracy, the State, and the Struggle for Global Justice (Routledge, 2009); Dangerous Professors: Academic Freedom and the National Security Campus (Michigan, 2009); and Exceptional State: Contemporary U.S. Culture and the New Imperialism (Duke, 2007). Dawson is editor of Social Text Online and a member of the Social Text collective. He is currently at work on a manuscript called Sea Change, which focuses on global cities and climate change. In the series following-up from last Falls Forms of Survival and the Politics of Vulnerability, Politics Beyond the Human continues to address notions of survival and how survival can act as a license to force and at other times a basis for resistance, while expanding the scope of inquiry to include discussions of the nonhuman world.

Cloudcuckooland: Adornos Musical Utopianism,Lecture: Non-Music Department,2014-04-21T17:00:00,2014-04-21T19:00:00,3335 Dwinelle Hall,"Fred Rush, Associate Professor of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame",The Program in Critical Theory,"Adorno has a complex attitude toward utopian thought. On the one hand, he views as dangerous and destructive fascist and vulgar Marxist strands of utopianism and has a subtle diagnostic critique of their attractions and deficiencies. On the other hand, he views the proper use of utopian imagination to be essential for human freedom and writes copiously about the dangers of prior ideological constraint not only of the content of imagination but also of the possible forms that imagination can take, political and otherwise. This paper joins an analysis of Adornos thought on utopianism with an exposition and critique of his interpretation of Mahlers symphonic practice. I argue that Adornos discussion of Mahler both takes precedence in his thought on artistic utopianism and clarifies his treatment of the continuing salience of utopian thought in politics.

In this talk, I propose a psychological constructivist perspective that can be used to understand the emotional lives of both humans and nonhuman animals. I begin by outlining a framework that maps the ingredients of emotion across phylogeny. Next, I present evidence of the existence of those ingredients in nonhuman primates (rhesus macaques). Specifically, I discuss how autonomic nervous system activity and behavioral reactivity data in rhesus macaques can give evidence of the psychological potency and affective value of dynamic visual stimuli. Researchers using such data can capitalize on the strengths of nonhuman primate models to identify the neurobiology that subserves the ingredients of emotion. For instance, I demonstrate early life damage to the amygdala permanently impairs affective responding in rhesus macaques. The implications for the evolution of emotion and translational social psychology will be discussed.",Psychology

When formalized, an apprenticeship often involved a ten-year indenture of a young boy or girl to a master or mistress. Unpaid labor was exchanged for entry into the mystery of the craft. The four conservatori or foundling homes of Naples were the first to institutionalize this indenture, ultimately aggregating as many as 600 boys for the intense study of music. Just as the four Inns of Court in London raised clerkship to a higher level in English law, so the conservatories of Naples created a critical mass of young talents such as Europe had never seen. By the end of the nineteenth century almost every industrializing nation had established its own version of a music conservatory. Perhaps the low social status of foundlings and performing musicians and their hermetic insiders praxis (a hold-over from the closed world of craft guilds) led educated writers on music to overlook or to deprecate the mindless repetitive exercises of the conservatories. Even when, at the Paris Conservatory, the work of replicating master patterns was raised to a level of finesse comparable to that of the École des Beaux-Arts, it was still not considered of any theoretical significance. Only from the mid-1990s did a small group of scholars begin to re-examine and rediscover what was being learned in the great conservatories. In modern terms, we can now recognize a systematic praxis aimed at the building up of a huge repertory of schemata or constructions, which collectively operated like what contemporary linguists term a usage-based grammar. The goal of such an undertaking would be to produce native speakers of a language, and the many great composers who emerged from this training would seem to support its efficacy.",Psychology

In this talk, Professor Gopnik will outline some of the new discoveries and their implications for the way we think about young children and ourselves. Human beings have a longer childhood than any other animal  our children are more helpless and dependent than any others. Why make babies so helpless for so long? Professor Gopnik will talk about how childhood is responsible for our uniquely human consciousness and our ability to learn, imagine and love and how this long protected childhood gives human babies an opportunity to learn, play and plan and work as adults. In their unstoppable pretend play, preschoolers use their discoveries to imagine new ways that the world might be. Children not only learn about the world around them, they also learn about other people and themselves. By the time they are three or four they understand love and morality. These remarkable learning abilities reflect special features of babies brains - features that may actually make babies more conscious than adults. Alison Gopnik is a professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley. She received her BA from McGill University and her PhD from Oxford University. She is an internationally recognized leader in the study of childrens learning and development and was the first to argue that childrens minds could help us understand deep philosophical questions. She is the author of over 100 journal articles and several books . She has also written widely about cognitive science and psychology for Science, The Times Literary Supplement, the New York Times, New Scientist and Slate, among others.

It will feature two of the worlds leading experts on the social and emotional dimensions to the helping professions, Shauna Shapiro, Ph.D., and Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D. Both Dr. Shapiro and Dr. Remen will provide insight into the challenges facing health professionals today and offer a compassionate, practical approach to addressing these challenges. Dr. Shapiro will lead the program. Based on her recent book, The Art and Science of Mindfulness: Integrating Mindfulness into Psychotherapy and the Helping Professions, she will offer scientific research and meditative practices for therapists interested in awakening the mind and opening the heart. Drawing on current research in psychology, medicine, and cognitive neuroscience, Dr. Shapiro will investigate the effects of mindfulness meditation on decreasing pathology and increasing positive psychological and physiological states. She will also explore the importance of self-care for health care professionals. Through lecture, meditation practices, clinical case examples, and small group activities, she will explore specific pathways of applying mindfulness personally and professionally to cultivate greater health, well-being, and freedom. Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D. Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D. In her special guest presentation, Dr. Remen will offer additional tools of self-care to help prevent burnout and foster well-being. She will discuss how health professionals training often convinces them that approaching work with a tender heart is unprofessional, yet this belief can make them vulnerable to depression, cynicism, loneliness, and a loss of meaning. Revitalizing their work, she will explain, requires bringing their heart into the center of it, making health professionals more open to moments of awareness and connection. In the process, they may find meaning in routine tasks and discover not only greater joy in daily work but even a sense of gratitude for that work. Her talk will provide innovative ways to make a healing difference for patients, clients, students, and yourself. Attendees will be able to: Identify the challenges health professionals face to sustaining meaning and avoiding burnout in their work Define mindfulness and describe Dr. Shapiros IAA model of mindfulness (Intention, Attention, and Attitude) Identify the effects mindfulness has on decreasing pathology and increasing positive psychological and physiological states Apply the science of mindfulness and self-compassion to their work Explain how investing more of themselves in their work can restore a sense of meaning, purpose, and service Presenter Information Event presented by the Greater Good Science Center, co-sponsored by the International House at UC Berkeley The Science of a Meaningful Life seminar series is made possible through a generous grant from the Quality of Life Foundation.",Psychology

However, that sentiment applies to a small fraction of humanity. This talk begins with a conceptualization of anger and related constructs in the context of everyday life, and then proceeds to a rationale for the treatment of dysfunctional anger. Here, the DSM-5 is a necessary point of reference though its shortcomings are worth acknowledging. In the regulation of anger, the cognitive behavioral approach with its roots in appraisal theory and learning theory remains dominant. However, it will be shown that new developments in theory and research encourage a more integrative approach to anger regulation. Preliminary treatment outcome data shed light on the challenges posed by this new approach. Inasmuch as treatment is informed by assessment, recent developments in the latter (especially the differentiation of a variety of anger parameters and expression styles) receive special mention. In conclusion, anger and related phenomena provide a testbed for theories of emotion that in turn can be applied towards the promotion of emotional health.",Psychology

After discussing a few of the major open questions in galaxy cluster formation and evolution, I'll present our recent work in attempting to model the non-thermal cosmic-ray population present in clusters. It is proposed that cosmic shocks that propagate through the intracluster medium form through the process of structure formation, and may be capable of accelerating charged particles through diffusive shock acceleration. These relativistic particles decay and radiate through a variety of mechanisms, and have observational signatures in radio, hard X-ray, and Gamma-ray wavelengths. Modelling these dynamics require a combination of cosmological hydrodynamics coupled with a model to follow the momentum-space distribution of cosmic ray electrons and protons. We have implemented such a model by combining Enzo, an Adaptive Mesh Refinement hydrodynamics + N-body particle-mesh gravity solver, with a numerical library for cosmic ray transport. I will end with a look to what future observatories in the radio, X-ray, and sub-mm may uncover and what new capabilities our simulations must have to understand fundamental physical processes present in galaxy clusters.",Astrophysics

A difficulty has been due to the uncertainty in the HI physical conditions, i.e., the spin temperature Ts and line optical depth which cannot be directly derived from single observed parameter, the HI brightness. It is discussed that there is dark gas which is not detectable either in the HI or CO emission in the Galaxy, and that H2 without CO may offer a possible explanation for the dark gas whose density may lie around several 100 cm-3. The dust properties derived by the Planck satellite offer a new accurate measure of the interstellar dust column density, and accordingly the gas column density. The new method, which I will present, allows us to estimate both Ts and HI column density. In this talk, I will present a comparison among CO, HI and Planck dust properties toward high-latitude CO clouds (MBM53-55), and show that the HI envelope around the CO clouds is very massive, in the order of 20,000Mo, as compared with the CO cloud whose mass is 2,000 Mo. Ts of the HI envelope is low in a range 20-80 K, where 70 % of the HI has Ts lower than 50 K and density higher than 100 cm-3. I will show that a similar trend is observed for the whole sky, and suggest that the cold and dense HI gas is common in the interstellar medium. I finally discuss such cold HI as the dark gas candidate.",Astrophysics

Sometime during this early period the intergalactic medium transitioned from a neutral gas to one that is fully ionized. How did this `cosmic reionization' occur and were star-forming galaxies responsible? The electron scattering optical depth inferred from cosmic microwave background observations suggests that reionization occurred sometime in the redshift interval z=20 to z=6 so probing the abundance, luminosity distribution and spectral properties of galaxies during this uncharted period holds the key to addressing these fundamental questions. Recent imaging with HST's Wide Field Camera 3 in conjunction with Spitzer photometry and Keck spectroscopy has provided important new insight into understanding when reionization occurred and the role of early galaxies in the process. I will review this progress and discuss the remaining challenges ahead of future facilities such as TMT and JWST.",Astrophysics

In this talk, Professor Gopnik will outline some of the new discoveries and their implications for the way we think about young children and ourselves. Human beings have a longer childhood than any other animal  our children are more helpless and dependent than any others. Why make babies so helpless for so long? Professor Gopnik will talk about how childhood is responsible for our uniquely human consciousness and our ability to learn, imagine and love and how this long protected childhood gives human babies an opportunity to learn, play and plan and work as adults. In their unstoppable pretend play, preschoolers use their discoveries to imagine new ways that the world might be. Children not only learn about the world around them, they also learn about other people and themselves. By the time they are three or four they understand love and morality. These remarkable learning abilities reflect special features of babies brains - features that may actually make babies more conscious than adults. Alison Gopnik is a professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley. She received her BA from McGill University and her PhD from Oxford University. She is an internationally recognized leader in the study of childrens learning and development and was the first to argue that childrens minds could help us understand deep philosophical questions. She is the author of over 100 journal articles and several books . She has also written widely about cognitive science and psychology for Science, The Times Literary Supplement, the New York Times, New Scientist and Slate, among others. Professor Gopnik has frequently appeared on TV and radio including, The Charlie Rose Show and The Colbert Report.",Tang Center

Our algorithm is based on recent results of Perkinson, Perlman and Wilmes concerning commutative algebraic aspects of chip firing on directed graphs.

More remarkably, these strategies are produced as solutions of Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem on the multidimensional unit simplex with a cost function that can be described as the log partition function. The ideas are an interplay between convex analysis, probability theory, and the geometry of the unit simplex. We will also show how this theory explains the presence of statistical arbitrage in high-frequency trading. Based on joint work with Leonard Wong.",Math

The method is applied to a shallow ice model of a glacier using data from one of the EISMINT test cases and the results are compared. We then show how assimilation of measured data can be used within the moving framework to improve the prediction of ice sheet movement. We develop a procedure for treating the mesh point positions, together with the ice thickness, as unknown state variables within the assimilation system. The correlation between the unknown mesh positions and the ice thickness is approximated by a simple correlation function that provides flow dependent co-variances. We demonstrate the success of the technique for noisy, very infrequent, partial measurements of ice thickness, both with and without noisy measurements of the position of the flow boundary.",Math

This confirms a conjecture of Fomin and Shapiro. I will briefly discuss some ingredients that went into the proof, including the role of the 0-Hecke algebra of a Coxeter group as well as a new criterion for deciding if a finite CW complex is regular with respect to a choice of characteristic maps; this is based on an interplay of combinatorics with topology.

The totally nonnegative spaces under consideration may be regarded as images of maps from polytopes which are generically injective, with fibers of these maps encoding relations among exponentiated Chevalley generators.

Many sophisticated results are available for the case of fixed volume, however, regimes in the direction of the thermodynamic limit seem fairly unexplored. I will report on a recent joint work with J. Froehlich, P. Pickl, and A.

Probability Seminar: Limit theorems for Smoluchowski dynamics associated with critical continuous-state branching processes,Seminar,2014-03-12T15:00:00,2014-03-12T16:00:00,Evans Hall,"Gautam Iyer, Carnegie Mellon University",Department of Statistics,"We will exploit a well-known connection (Bertoin, Le Gall '06) between critical continuous-state branching processes (CSBP) that are absorbed at $0$ and the generalized Smoluchowski coagulation equation to prove a variety of limit theorems. We establish a fundamental connection between the existence of a non-degenerate scaling limit and regular variation (at $0$) of the branching mechanism. In particular, we show: 1. A non-degenerate scaling limit of a critical CSBP (absorbed at $0$) exists if and only if the branching mechanism is regularly varying at 0. 2. The CDF of the rescaled process conditioned on survival has a nondegenerate limit if and only if the branching mechanism is regularly at $0$. When the scaling limits exist, we can further characterise the nondegenerate scaling limits of arbitrary finite-measure solutions in terms of generalized Mittag-Leffler series. This is joint work with Nicholas Leger and Robert Pego.",Math
Applied Math Seminar: The Smile of the Mathematicians. Mathematical Modelling and Simulation in Facial Surgery.,Seminar,2014-03-12T15:30:00,2014-03-12T16:30:00,939 Evans Hall,"Peter Deuflhard, Freie Universität Berlin",Department of Mathematics,"Some mathematicians have a problem with a smile – a mathematical one. The talk will present results of a joint project with surgeons in the field of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery. In this kind of surgery, faces are operatively changed to get rid of unpleasant face distortions. Bone from the upper or lower jaws is removed or shifted up to cm's. The questions treated by mathematicians are: (1) operation planning within teleconferences of ZIB and the clinic, based on a detailed geometric model of skull and facial tissue, (2) prediction of the facial appearance on the basis of numerical simulation of the patient's soft tissue, based on fast adaptive multilevel finite element methods for the elastomechanic partial differential equations, either the linear Navier-Lamé equations or nonlinear enrichments like geometric nonlinearity or nonlinear material laws of Ogden type. As is well-known, nonlinear mechanics leads to nonconvex optimization. Extensions of affine conjugate Newton methods for convex optimization problems to the nonconvex case here (more precisely: polyconvex case) are given. During the talk, a lot of results for real patients are inserted, including possible effects on the smile.",Math

The different possibilities exactly define these strata. {\it Positive real geometry.} Very few matroid strata intersect the semialgebraic locus where all the Plücker coordinates are no negative. The closures of those that do give this stratification. {\it Projected Richardson varieties.} The full flag manifold has a similarly nice decomposition, rather simply given by the intersections of Schubert and opposite Schubert varieties. But magically, when we project it to $Gr(k,n)$ it acquires this cyclic symmetry. {\it Characteristic $p$ geometry.} If we consider $n$-space over a perfect field of characteristic $p$, there is a natural ""Frobenius splitting"" giving a sort of $p$th root operator on the sheaf of functions. Such an operator always stabilizes only finitely many ideals, and on the Grassmannian those ideals correspond to these strata. And best of all, the most natural way to index these strata is by juggling patterns, which I will define and demonstrate; they are a class of permutations in the affine Weyl group of type A. I'll explain the geometric connection to the affine flag manifold, which requires juggling antimatter (which I won't demonstrate). This work is joint with Thomas Lam and David Speyer.",Math

These spaces were then utilized by Gromov and Witten as invariants arising from string field theory and quantum cohomology. Later, Kontsevich and Fukaya generalized these ideas when studying deformation quantization to include surfaces with boundary and marked points. We consider a combinatorial framework to view the compactification of this space based on the pair-of-pants decomposition of the surface. This leads to a classification of all such spaces which can be realized as polytopes, capturing elegant hidden algebraic structures.",Math

The trace of the wave group, which on the one hand equals $\sum e^{-it\lambda _j}$ where $\lambda _j^2$ are the eigenvalues of the Laplacian, is on the other hand a distribution in $t$ which is singular at the lengths of closed geodesics. Those closed geodesics that interact with the cone points generically do so ""diffractively"", carrying singularities into regions of phase space inaccessible to ordinary geodesic flow. We describe a formula for the leading order singularity of the wave trace at the lengths of closed diffractive geodesics, generalizing the formula due of Duistermaat and Guillemin in the smooth setting and that of Hillairet in the setting of flat surfaces with conic singularities.",Math

Topology Seminar (Main Talk): On a nilpotence conjecture of J.P. May,Seminar,2014-04-02T16:00:00,2014-04-02T17:00:00,3 Evans Hall,"Justin Noel, Regensburg",Department of Mathematics,"In 1986 Peter May made the following conjecture: Suppose that $R$ is a ring spectrum with power operations (e.g., an $E_\infty $ring spectrum/ commutative $S$-algebra). Then the torsion elements in the kernel of the integral Hurewicz homomorphism $\pi _* R\rightarrow H_* (R;\mathbb {Z})$ are nilpotent. If $R$ is the sphere spectrum, this is Nishida's nilpotence theorem. If we strengthen the condition on the integral homology to a condition about the complex bordism of $R$, then this is a special case of the nilpotence theorem of Devinatz, Hopkins, and Smith. The proof is short and simple, using only results that have been around since the late 90's. As a corollary we obtain results on the non-existence of commutative $S$-algebra structures on various quotients of $MU$. For example $MU/(p^i)$ or $ku/(p^i v)$ for $i>0$. We also obtain new results about the behavior of the Adams spectral sequence for Thom and THH spectra. This project is joint with Akhil Mathew and Niko Naumann.

In this case, and going all the way back to Schur and Burchnall-Chaundy there is a remarkable link with ""curves"" and bundles on them. This is part of the $\bf Korteweg/deVries, NLS,Toda$ connection between differential equations and algebraic geometry that flourished in the 70's. I will then consider matrix valued versions of this problem which lead to very concrete noncommutative matrix algebras. What is missing so far is a good description of these algebras,a solid connection with integrable systems (some have already appeared such as $\bf Spin$ $\bf Calogero/Moser$), and a replacement for a curve.

Though traditionally considered separate domains, visual and digital surveillance practices are being combined as machine vision, facial recognition and other technologies become more sophisticated and interoperable. Institutional surveillance by semi-autonomous drones and remote cameras, citizen video monitoring, and incessant photo-sharing and tagging on social networks enable perpetual documentation.

U.S.A. and Japan have been taking different paths to the implementation and ratification of the CRPD. While Japan ratified the CRPD in January 2014 after the passage of the Act on Elimination of Disability Discrimination in June 2013, the CRPD ratification remains a political issue in U.S.A, which has a number of civil rights achievements, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. This open forum, organized by Center for Japanese Studies (UCB), Center for Global Studies (University of Shizuoka), Research Center for Ars Vivendi (Ritsumeikan University) and IRIS, has three distinguished speakers from Japan and U.S. Professor Ishikawa Jun of University of Shizuoka will discuss the overall harmonization efforts of Japan towards the implementation of the CRPD, giving particular attention to information accessibility. In addition to being the chair of Disability Policy Committee of the government of Japan, Dr. Ishikawa is a developer of Assistive technologies for blind users and used to chair a non-profit organization working for information accessibility for the blind. Professor Peter Blanck, University Professor & Chairman of the Burton Blatt Institute at Syracuse University, will talk about U.S. and transnational disability policy and law in regard to Web accessibility for persons across the spectrum of disability. Dr. Blancks forthcoming book, entitled eQuality: The Struggle for Access to the Web (Cambridge Press, 2014), examines the future of Web Equality under the ADA, the CRPD and other states domestic laws.

We also consider how open access regimes connect to food sovereignty  the rights of local people to define their own food systems. In recent years, open-source licensing has emerged as a new approach to protect the seed innovations of farmers and plant breeders and provide them with access to diversified germplasm. Like open-source software, open-source seeds would create a protected commons in which materials are freely available and widely exchanged, but are protected from appropriation by monopoly interests. Similarly, land has become the focus of redoubled efforts to facilitate open access to resources for food production  the Landless Workers Movement in Brazil is one prominent example. We ask: what are the ways in which managing access to agricultural resources  whether plant genes or land can promote the common good, and how might these ways change in different cultural and political contexts? A panel discussion moderated by David Winickoff, Associate Professor of Bioethics and Society in CNR, and Director of the Berkeley Program in Science and Technology Studies. The panel will feature: Jack Kloppenburg, Professor of Community and Environmental Sociology, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Co-Director of the Center for Integrated Agriculture Systems. Kloppenburg specializes in the social impacts of biotechnology and the global controversy over access to and control over genetic resources. He is interested in applying open source principles in the biosciences. Wendy Wolford, Associate Professor of Sociology, Cornell University.

Some of the resources that California is pursuing to manage this ramp are demand response, generation diversity, fast response natural gas plants, and energy storage. This talk will discuss the tools and analytics the California Public Utilities Commission and the state are pursing to address integration and promote flexible resources.

Resolution is lost, detail is changed and fineness is compromised. In this process, however, extra pixels may also be added, ultimately transforming and re-authoring the resulting Doppelgänger image. Long interested in issues of analog-to-digital mistranslations, public access, and flows of information and capital, visual artist Stephanie Syjuco will present recent projects exploring the murky territory of the physicality of objects in relationship to virtual space, ""resolution"" as a metaphor for craft, and authorship in an era of co-authored or crowdsourced information. By flipping the loss of original resolution from being a negative condition into a potentially generative one, her works scrutinize how active transformation occurs through misuse and degradation. Perhaps this new, bastard un-original has much more to say by way of poetic narrative, speculative fiction and alternative readings than its static predecessor ever did. Syjuco will also introduce several ongoing projects utilizing online networks such as Facebook, Ebay, Google searches, and Craigslist to explore how the cannibalization of what appear to be limited structures of use and interaction can be leveraged towards critique. Syjuco is a visual artist and educator who utilizes physical surrogates, counterfeits and digital networks to address the political and social implications of economies and labor in an era of late capitalism. She has participated in numerous exhibitions including at: MoMA/P.S.1, the Whitney Museum of American Art, The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Frieze Projects (London), ZKM Center for Art and Technology (Germany), Z33 Space for Contemporary Art (Belgium), Universal Studios Gallery (Beijing) and Garanti Gallery (Istanbul), among others. She is currently collaborating with the FLACC Workplace for Visual Artists in Genk, Belgium, on a new body of work utilizing 3-D scanning of Belgian and Congolese antiquities to produce hybrid objects addressing the legacy of colonialism, empire, and trade routes. She is an Assistant Professor in Sculpture and Ceramic Sculpture at UC Berkeley. The ATC series is produced by the Berkeley Center for New Media (BCNM), with support from the Office of the Vice Chancellor and Provost, the Center for Information Technology in the Interest of Society (CITRIS), Meyer Sound and Theo Armour.",Art History

Our framework, concise comparative summarization (CCS), is built on sparse classification methods. It is a lightweight and flexible tool that offers a compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently in wide use and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We argue that sparse methods have much to offer for text analysis and hope CCS opens the door for a new branch of research in this important field. Using news articles from the New York Times, we validate our tool by designing and conducting a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human understanding. We demonstrate our approach with two case studies, a media analysis of the framing of Egypt in the New York Times throughout the Arab Spring and an informal comparison of the New York Times and Wall Street Journals coverage of energy. Overall, we find that the Lasso with L2 normalization can be effectively and usefully used to summarize large corpora, regardless of document size. Finally, I will present preliminary results in an on-going project to study the opinions of U.S. courts of appeal by using CCS in combination with LDA.",Political Science

The subsequent aftershocks, fires, and ensuing panic bred rumors that malcontent Koreans living in Japan were setting the fires, poisoning water wells, and plotting a revolution. To prevent this alleged uprising, vigilantes along with police and the military massacred more than 6,000 Koreans. Partly to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the massacre, two unreleased rare documentaries from Japan have been touring the United States since last September. The films feature interviews with Japanese and Korean survivors, and the first of the two sequel films ""Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans From the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo, 1923 will be shown. The movie was directed by Choonkong Oh, a Korean resident of Japan, and is in Japanese and Korean with English subtitles.

The symposium has historically stood for a platform and voice for our homeless clients and friends to advocate for themselves and changes that need to be made in the Berkeley community as a whole. We anticipate an audience of 100 or more students and community members hoping to engage in homelessness and poverty action. We want to hold our public socially responsible to the marginalization that continues to occur. Our hope is that this symposium will push people to alter the circumstances that allow for poverty to persist. Though our focus for the week is on inequity, we're all taking a look at intersectionality. What are the ways in which poverty intersects with gender issues, or disaster relief?

Ankaras main objective was to transform this region into a Turkish sphere of influence. However, the ambitious and political dimension of this vision for Central Asia and the Caucasus has gradually been abandoned. A more realistic and balanced policy has been adopted, giving priority to cultural, economic, and religious cooperation. Realizing that these countries were very sensitive to their new independence and sovereignty, Turkey has started to privilege bilateral relations with each country rather than adopting a global and integrationist approach. The goal of this lecture is to develop the main outreaches of Turkish policy in this region, mainly in the sphere of cultural, educational, and religious cooperation  areas where an incontestable Turkish soft power is currently in development.",Political Science

But unlike last time, he has no money, no machine, no nothing. In his previous 2005 by-election depicted in ""Campaign"", Kazuhiko ""Yama-san"" Yamauchi was the official candidate of the LDP, headed by then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. He won the vacant seat, fully backed by the LDP's political machine. However, for the election in 2007, the LDP did not endorse Yama-san, and backed a different candidate. For the past 4 years, Yama-san has stayed away from politics, living as a ""house husband"" to raise his newborn son Yuki. So, this election in 2011 is a come-back attempt by Yama-san after 4 quiet years. But the situation is not so forgiving. The total budget for his campaign is now only 84,720 Japanese Yen (about $850)  all for printing posters and postcards. Does he even stand a chance? Filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda debuted with ""Campaign"" in 2007 at the Berlinale, and has been winning international awards with his observational film series such as ""Mental"" (2008), ""Peace"" (2010), and ""Theatre 1 & 2"" (2012). ""Campaign 2"" candidly captures the mechanical lives of the Japanese people, firmly adhered to even in the midst of a disaster where radioactive material is falling from the sky. Soda's camera, which had maintained an outsider's position in ""Campaign, gradually gets ensnared in the situation.

In exposing these features of the interaction of modern law and religion, the talk will touch on issues such as the way in which religion is transformed by laws gaze, the strange relationship of law to choice and freedom in its treatment of religion, and the troubled life of legal toleration. Drawing on the experience of religious diversity and the law in Canada, where the rhetoric of legal multiculturalism has been particularly powerful, the talk seeks to set the stage for a better account of the interaction of law and religion in any liberal constitutional order. Benjamin L. Berger is an Associate Professor at Osgoode Hall Law School at York University in Toronto and is a member of the faculty of Yorks Graduate Program in Socio-Legal Studies. His research and teaching focuses on the interplay between religious difference and the culture of laws rule; the social functions of criminal and constitutional law; and the nature, quality, and virtues of legal judgment. Prior to joining Osgoode, Professor Berger was an associate professor in the Faculty of Law and held a cross appointment in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Victoria, where he began teaching in 2004. He served as law clerk to the Rt. Honourable Beverley McLachlin, Chief Justice of Canada, and was a Fulbright Scholar at Yale University, where he earned his LL.M. and J.S.D. His work has appeared broadly in edited collections and legal and interdisciplinary journals. He is an associate editor of Hart Publishings series Constitutional Systems of the World and is the incoming editor-in-chief of the Canadian Journal of Law and Society.

The Amerikan Steppes: The Great Plains in a Russian Mirror,Lecture,2014-03-18T16:00:00,2014-03-18T17:30:00,270 Stephens Hall,"David Moon, Anniversary Professor of History, The University of York","Institute of Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ISEEES)","This paper  based on my new book project - explores connections between the steppes and the Great Plains. The two regions share similar environments  both are semi-arid grasslands  and environmental histories  on both, indigenous populations who lived mobile lifestyles based on livestock (Plains Indians and steppe nomads) were displaced by farmers of European origins or backgrounds who ploughed up the fertile soil to grow crops. This process started first on the steppes. Between the mid-C19th and mid-C20th, there were a series of transfers between the two grasslands. The extent to which Russian and Soviet steppe farming drew on American machinery and also organization is well known. Not quite as well known, and especially not in their entirety, are the transfers the other way, from the steppes to the Great Plains:  Migration by Mennonites and Volga Germans.  The introduction of drought- and disease-resistant varieties of wheat, most famously Turkey Red, and also other crops.  The adoption by the US Soil Survey of a methodology based on Russian genetic soil science. The Russian approach was devised on the basis of field work in the black-region of the forest-steppe and steppe in the late C19; American soil scientists tested it on the Great Plains.  The Prairie States Forestry Project  the planting of shelterbelts on the Great Plains in the 1930s  was based on Russian steppe forestry and masterminded by a Russian-born American forester  Raphael Zon.  The most lasting legacy of the connections between the steppes and Great Plains may well be the tumbleweed. Now and icon of the American West, seeds of perekati pole were imported accidentally in a sack of flax seed by Mennonite migrants to the Dakotas in the late-C19 and then spread rapidly and destructively across the West.",Political Science

Only the men and women who live behind bars are fully invested in the truth, are willing and able to bear witness to the state of our prisons, and are subjects of sufficient public fascination to be heard by a broad public. This talk will present Fourth City: Essays from the Prison in America, a collection of 71 essays from writers incarcerated in 27 American states. Fourth City is the largest collection to date of first-person witness to how the American prison is experienced by those living inside it. Fourth City presents the prison population as it sees itself: not as a regrettable abstraction or liability of the neoliberal state, but as an extant community of 2.26 million living under hostile supervision, and for this reason experiencing a life more cohesive, across an archipelago of facilities, than that experienced by residents of New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago. Fourth City presents incarcerated Americans as a national constituency, and as the constituency best positioned to witness what is wrong with current prison practice in the U.S., its real effects on its wards, and how the prison in America fails the mission of correction so badly. The talk will also discuss a Digital Humanities project now in progress, The American Prison Writing Archive. The APWA is planned as an open-source, digital archive of non-fiction, American prison writing, including the work of incarcerated people, prison staff, administrators, and volunteers. Fourth City and the APWA are efforts to relocate those directly affected by the prison complex from the periphery to the center of the conversation about mass incarceration in the U.S. today.",Political Science

The Concept of the Distributed Center Subject: Its Philosophical and Practical Applications Hélène Mialet, Visiting Scholar, The Program in Critical Theory 2 April, 2014, 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm 340 Moffitt Library, UC Berkeley In following the moderns in the making of scientific knowledge, STS scholars have shown an interesting discrepancy between what scientists do in practice and what they say they do in theory. Indeed, scientific objectivity has been entirely reconfigured and reinterpreted in very different ways. In continuity with this endeavor, and because the definition of the object goes hand in hand with the definition of the subject, one of my obsessions has been to re-interrogate the definition of the knowing subject. If another definition of scientific objectivity emerges, and if science is socially or collectively and materially madedepending on our conception of the socialwhat does this do to our classical notion of the knowing subject? What does it do to the most powerful and operative myth of the modern: the disincorporated brain? And by extension, what does it do to our notions of the person, the individual genius, the rational actor, the psyche, and or subjectivity, to which this myth is anchored? Believing in the strength of doing empirical philosophy, Stephen Hawking struck me as a beautiful empirical case: in part because he is the incarnation of one of the most powerful myths of the modernsthe brain in a vatand in part because (or as a consequence) he is a counter example that pushes the boundaries of what STS has taught us. Following the traces of his presence I have reconstructed the mediations that make a knowing subject. Through this research I have developed the concept of the distributed centered subject. I will discuss the philosophical and practical implications of such a concept. A PhD-trained scholar and writer with degrees from the Sorbonne and the Centre de Sociologie de lInnovation de lEcole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Paris, Hélène Mialets research interests are in continental philosophy, science and technology studies, and social theory. She has held post-docs at Oxford and Cambridge Universities and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, and positions at Cornell, Berkeley, and Harvard. She is most recently the author of Hawking Incorporated (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), an ethnographic study of abstraction and formalism, focusing on the case of Stephen Hawking as a means of exploring larger questions about singularity, identity, distributed agency, subjectivity, corporeality and socio-technical networks. In the series following-up from last Falls Forms of Survival and the Politics of Vulnerability, Politics Beyond the Human continues to address notions of survival and how survival can act as a license to force and at other times a basis for resistance, while expanding the scope of inquiry to include discussions of the nonhuman world.

We turn our backs on the waters that surround us to our great peril. For many years, experts of various stripes have been warning about the threat posed to the city by climate change-induced rising tides. In 1999, for example, the Environmental Defense Fund published a report titled Hot Nights in the City: Global Warming, Sea-Level Rise, and the New York Metropolitan Region. A decade later, MoMA and P.S.1 collaborated on a design competition, Rising Tides: Projects for New Yorks Waterfront, that was intended to explore innovative solutions to the citys heightened vulnerability to storm-surge induced inundation. Yet when Hurricane Sandy struck New York just over a year ago, the city seemed almost totally unprepared for the infrastructural and human emergencies provoked by this natural disaster. Numerous factors combined to make New York vulnerable to Sandy, but underlying them all was the fact that weve largely forgotten our citys links to its maritime environment. Since the spread of mass air transport, few of us travel long distances on the surface of the planets oceans. Even fewer of us actually depend directly on the sea for our livelihoods. In the words of the filmmaker Alan Sekula, the oceans have become the worlds forgotten space, an occult zone absolutely crucial to global economic exchange and yet almost totally elided from cultural representation. This is the story of how we forgot the sea. Ashley Dawson is Professor of English at the City University of New Yorks Graduate Center and at the College of Staten Island/CUNY.

They attach to these ideas and beliefs, and they fight over them -- this only leads suffering. The word for that is ""ignorance"". Not only that, but through their intense desire, anger and ignorance, human beings are exterminating all life on this planet through a mindless pursuit of material comfort and temporary ease. If human beings do not soon ""wake up,"" they risk ending life for so many species of living things, not only themselves. ""Zen"" (meditation) means returning to the fundamental, true Self - which comes before nationality or religion. An American-born Zen monk and graduate of Yale and Harvard, Hyon Gak Sunim ordained as a monk in 1992. In his talk, he will stress that meditation is not based on religion, belief, or dogma. It is scientifically tested, peer-reviewed and affirmed technology for human beings to reach their innermost depths and most creative possibilities. As we well know, recent scientific studies have proven that meditation frees up creative forces, unleashes unconscious creativities, and generates non-sectarian bases for genuine fellow-feeling and modes of compassionate interaction. The explosive field of neuroplasticity itself proves that when human beings spend even just a few minutes a day, following their breath and noticing deeply their thought-patterns, they are subtly freed from entrapping patterns of thought and feeling. This talk will introduce to the public the basic teaching of Zen, and its central technology of looking into one's true nature.",Political Science

Torn between the demands of dogma, reason, and spiritual experience ever since the origins of their movement in the Reformation, evangelicals struggle  more than most people  to reconcile competing sources of intellectual authority at once. This ongoing crisis has produced a culture that observers and believers alike have called anti-intellectual. Yet evangelical defenders insist that their approach to education and critical inquiry is no more biased or blinkered than that of secular thinkers; if anything, it is more honest. An examination of how 20th-century American evangelicals have navigated the straits between religious and secular authorities in the realms of science, history, and worship suggests that this crisis is both evangelicals greatest bane and an abiding source of strength.",Political Science

On the one hand, he views as dangerous and destructive fascist and vulgar Marxist strands of utopianism and has a subtle diagnostic critique of their attractions and deficiencies. On the other hand, he views the proper use of utopian imagination to be essential for human freedom and writes copiously about the dangers of prior ideological constraint not only of the content of imagination but also of the possible forms that imagination can take, political and otherwise. This paper joins an analysis of Adornos thought on utopianism with an exposition and critique of his interpretation of Mahlers symphonic practice. I argue that Adornos discussion of Mahler both takes precedence in his thought on artistic utopianism and clarifies his treatment of the continuing salience of utopian thought in politics.

U.S. foreign policy has been very influential all over the world. How the U.S. government reacted to the 3/11 Fukushimas Nuclear Disaster has had significant impact on Japan and other countries. The purpose of this presentation is to explore the U.S. foreign policy and its impact regarding to the nuclear disaster. Mei-tzu,Tsai may611103@yahoo.com.tw An observation of others suffering A Study of the Disaster Writings, Thoughts and Cultural Identity of Japan-educated Chinese Writers Before and After the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake The death toll from the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 has been estimated at nearly 130,000. After the earthquake, it was rumored that Koreans were poisoning wells. Radical Japanese activists thus sought to identify what they termed not-their-own-people, those with strange accents and pronunciation, in an attempt to find and kill Koreans. Some of the Chinese residents in the area were then mistakenly identified as Koreans and killed. The Great Kanto Earthquake as a context of discourse on the cultural relationship between China, Korea and Japan to some extent represents an imagination of a common body of East Asia, which contains many unstable elements and potential conflicts arising from differences in national identity, national character and national power. The Great Kanto Earthquake highlighted the fact that Japan would always be threatened by its location in an earthquake-prone zone. The rise in militarism was hoped to insure that Japan would always have the option of taking over the land and resources of China. In the face of the suffering of his Japanese neighbors, 郭沫若Guo Moruo wrote to express his feelings and thoughts on natural disasters within the context of a heterogeneous culture. He began his literary career as a romanticist writer, and later redirected his literary interest to a variety of fields and creations, ranging from historical plays to studies of ancient society, translation of works on Marxism and writings of communist militarism. This project intends to explore ideas about the Great Kanto earthquake expressed by Gou and other Japanese-educated Chinese writers in order to better understand the relationship between Chinese and Japanese intellectuals in this complicated era. Besides, While the Chinese writer Guo was described as the son of Asia by the Japanese writer Satou Haruo, Japan was seen as the greatest empire in East Asia from the Japanese perspective. The change in Guos ideas about Japan can be understood in the context of the emergence of an East Asia Discourse in the early 20th century. Japanese scholar Ito notes that both Chinese and Japanese intellectuals attempted to pursue surpassing national values in order to develop international communism, such asIn the mid-1920s, the pro-Japanese Chinese writer周作人 Zhou Zuoren learned from Saneatsu Mushanokōji the Ideal of New Villagea commune in which all people farm and read together, and help each other. That is ideal Communism society. Although their efforts repeatedly failed. The divisions and networks among many organizations, societies and groups in Europe, America and Asia can be traced back to the works produced by Chinese and Japanese writers during the period of 1920-1940.",Political Science

Henry, Assistant Professor of History, UC San Diego",Center for Korean Studies (CKS),"The title of this talk is meant to signal two related topics for discussion. The first refers to my new book, ""Assimilating Seoul: Japanese Rule and The Politics of Public Space in Colonial Korea, 1910-1945"" (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2014). The introductory part of the talk reviews the central argument of that book  namely, that public space functioned as contact zones wherein varying projects of assimilation were both implanted by state officials and contested by their non-elite users. The second part of the talk extends this story beyond the liberation of 1945 and into the history of South Korea. In this context, the title refers to the project of recasting the capital city as a capitalist and anti-communist focus of post-colonial politics. After briefly examining the post-liberation strategy of erasure, the fate of Namsans Shintō Shrines, I turn to the more common strategy of decolonization, which involved creatively recycling the citys palace grounds before ultimately restoring them. To trace this decolonizing strategy, I explore the fate of Changgyŏng Garden, whose popular zoo, park, museum and other recreational facilities persisted long after 1945. Meanwhile, the early architects of South Korea creatively re-used this site for new national purposes, including to memorialize anti-communist patriots and to showcase the countrys infant industries. It was only over the next three decades that the overlapping functions of this public space were separated into distinct sites, each capable of carrying out a specific role in re-subjectifying the citizenry.",Political Science

Music Studies Colloquium - Gjerdingen: The Institutionalization of Apprenticeship in the Great Conservatories: A Cognitive Interpretation of a Non-Verbal Praxis,Performing Arts - Music,2014-03-17T16:30:00,2014-03-17T18:00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Robert Gjerdingen, Northwestern University",Department of Music,"Music, like all the other crafts of pre-industrial Europe, was learned through apprenticeship. When formalized, an apprenticeship often involved a ten-year indenture of a young boy or girl to a master or mistress. Unpaid labor was exchanged for entry into the mystery of the craft. The four conservatori or foundling homes of Naples were the first to institutionalize this indenture, ultimately aggregating as many as 600 boys for the intense study of music. Just as the four Inns of Court in London raised clerkship to a higher level in English law, so the conservatories of Naples created a critical mass of young talents such as Europe had never seen. By the end of the nineteenth century almost every industrializing nation had established its own version of a music conservatory. Perhaps the low social status of foundlings and performing musicians and their hermetic insiders praxis (a hold-over from the closed world of craft guilds) led educated writers on music to overlook or to deprecate the mindless repetitive exercises of the conservatories. Even when, at the Paris Conservatory, the work of replicating master patterns was raised to a level of finesse comparable to that of the École des Beaux-Arts, it was still not considered of any theoretical significance. Only from the mid-1990s did a small group of scholars begin to re-examine and rediscover what was being learned in the great conservatories. In modern terms, we can now recognize a systematic praxis aimed at the building up of a huge repertory of schemata or constructions, which collectively operated like what contemporary linguists term a usage-based grammar. The goal of such an undertaking would be to produce native speakers of a language, and the many great composers who emerged from this training would seem to support its efficacy.",Performances

They were produced in Switzerland and Germany in exceptionally prolific artisan environments. The artisans designed them so that they not merely played music but also performed contemporary sentimental-musical body techniques (through moving their eyes, heads, and torsos) to communicate affects to the audience that were generated by the musical piece. My talk investigates the artisan and musical-cultural environments in which androids and their meanings were produced in the eighteenth century and probes also the boundaries between such different economic and cultural environments. The talk's second part traces how eighteenth-century musical automata's interpretations changed significantly during the industrial revolutions of the 19th and the wars of the 20th centuries: literary and cultural critics detached them from their original musical-historical context and appropriated them as harbingers of the catastrophes of industrial modernity. The musical element of the mechanics of the androids helps me rescue this part of their android identity and thus re-visit both technical and cultural modernities.",Performances

Music Studies Colloquium - Wong: Rereading Ethnomusicology for Gender and Erotics,Performing Arts - Music,2014-04-07T16:30:00,2014-04-07T18:00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Deborah Wong, UC Riverside",Department of Music,"How and why did gender studies move so quickly through ethnomusicology, and then (mostly) disappear? Why has sexuality studies barely made any appearance at all, despite musics central role in shaping desire? Ethnomusicology moved to a post-gender stance with lightning speed. That is, after key publications about women/gender and music in the 1980s-90s, ethnomusicologists began to add the phrase and gender to their arguments but to a great extent stopped focusing on it. As Ellen Koskoff has written, after a brief spurt in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, work in feminist and genderist ethnomusicology seemed to slow in relation to that of musicology(Koskoff 2005, 90). I offer a reclamation model meant to dialogically regroup, recoup, and reformulate existing ethnomusicological scholarship. Attention to gendered orders of music is missing from much of our most treasured literature, and I aim to reread itto read it anew, to read it with new eyesnot in order to rescue it but to fold the gesture of critique into our work as I make visible the invisibility of gender in so much of our best scholarship. This is in some ways homage and in others an openly counterfactual history. I will reread my own book on Thai music by folding in current media coverage of spectacularly misogynistic demonstrations against the female Prime Minister. I will reread several key monographs by other ethnomusicologists to consider the range of acts available to usradical rereading, evocative/poetic rereading, mournful rereadingwhile arguing that this agentive feminist act of reading (refusing the apparent absence) is an extension of the gaze exerted by subalterns of many kinds in many places. I aim to activate a bifocal consciousness and to exert the black look articulated by bell hooks to theorize a reading method for ethnomusicologists that traces the ghostly presence of gender and erotics, reading around their apparent absence for their outlines and sonic traces. I will draw from the abundance of theories addressing the act of oppositional watching/listening and theories for rereading from philosophy and education, which emphasize how re-knowing and re-cognition is part of the rereading process. Can a second reading open up a third space? Neither a rescue operation nor an apologist celebration, this is instead a deeply necessary and respectful effort to reengage with (rather than disengage from) leading scholarship by ethnomusicologists that has mostly turned a blind eye toward gender and sexuality. I offer both a practical method and a theory of rereading drawn from feminist theory, minoritarian studies, and translation studies.",Performances

The subsequent aftershocks, fires, and ensuing panic bred rumors that malcontent Koreans living in Japan were setting the fires, poisoning water wells, and plotting a revolution. To prevent this alleged uprising, vigilantes along with police and the military massacred more than 6,000 Koreans. Partly to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the massacre, two unreleased rare documentaries from Japan have been touring the United States since last September. The films feature interviews with Japanese and Korean survivors, and the first of the two sequel films ""Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans From the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo, 1923 will be shown. The movie was directed by Choonkong Oh, a Korean resident of Japan, and is in Japanese and Korean with English subtitles. The documentary is under an hour long, and will be followed by a discussion featuring Jinhee Lee, a history professor at Eastern Illinois University whose research focuses on the competing narratives of collective violence in the Japanese empire.",Films

But unlike last time, he has no money, no machine, no nothing. In his previous 2005 by-election depicted in ""Campaign"", Kazuhiko ""Yama-san"" Yamauchi was the official candidate of the LDP, headed by then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. He won the vacant seat, fully backed by the LDP's political machine. However, for the election in 2007, the LDP did not endorse Yama-san, and backed a different candidate. For the past 4 years, Yama-san has stayed away from politics, living as a ""house husband"" to raise his newborn son Yuki. So, this election in 2011 is a come-back attempt by Yama-san after 4 quiet years. But the situation is not so forgiving. The total budget for his campaign is now only 84,720 Japanese Yen (about $850)  all for printing posters and postcards. Does he even stand a chance? Filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda debuted with ""Campaign"" in 2007 at the Berlinale, and has been winning international awards with his observational film series such as ""Mental"" (2008), ""Peace"" (2010), and ""Theatre 1 & 2"" (2012). ""Campaign 2"" candidly captures the mechanical lives of the Japanese people, firmly adhered to even in the midst of a disaster where radioactive material is falling from the sky. Soda's camera, which had maintained an outsider's position in ""Campaign, gradually gets ensnared in the situation. Conflict between the filmmaker and the subjects eventually escalates and finally comes to a head. Official film website",Films
