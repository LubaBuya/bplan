A Reassessment of Hebbian Mechanisms in Visual System Development by in vivo Imaging,Seminar: Oxyopia Seminar,2014-03-03T11:00:00,2014-03-03T12:30:00,489 Minor Hall,"Edward S. Ruthazer, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University","Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","I n 1949 Donald Hebb put forth an influential model proposing that learning may be manifested by a growth process between neuronal partners in the brain that exhibited correlated firing such that the presynaptic cell had participated in causing its postsynaptic partner to fire. The NMDA receptor has been identified as a molecular detector of correlated firing due to its voltage-dependence. Developmental refinement of neuronal circuits is also thought to exploit similar correlation-dependent mechanisms. Consistent with this idea, numerous studies have shown that NMDA receptor blockade or genetic knockout disrupts normal developmental plasticity and circuit refinement. Using a combination of targeted genetic manipulation, and time lapse imaging of axonal remodeling in response to patterned visual stimuli in vivo, we explore the contributions of correlated firing and NMDA receptors in the Xenopus retinotectal system, a classic experimental model for the study of activity-dependent visual system refinement.",Neuroscience

Plasticity of binocularity and acuity are differentially limited by Nogo Receptor,Seminar: Oxyopia Seminar,2014-03-10T11:00:00,2014-03-10T12:30:00,489 Minor Hall,"Aaron McGee, USC","Neuroscience Institute, Helen Wills","Why does discordant vision only during childhood induce amblyopia (lazy-eye)? Why does this disorder cause enduring visual impairment even if the underlying causes are corrected in adulthood? This is in part because experience-dependent plasticity is limited in the maturing brain by factors present in the neuropil, including myelination and the extracellular matrix. The neuronal Nogo receptor (NgR1) gene is required to close the critical period for visual plasticity. Mice lacking this gene retain developmental visual plasticity as adults and spontaneously recover normal visual acuity in a rodent model of amblyopia. We are investigating how NgR1 restricts visual plasticity with a combination of mouse genetics, electrophysiology, chronic in vivo imaging, and behavioral assays. Our preliminary result reveal that although eye dominance and acuity are both impaired by abnormal vision, the plasticity of these facets of visual function may rely on distinct cortical circuitry",Neuroscience

Large-scale data has potential to transform almost every aspect of our world, from science to business; for this potential to be realized, we must turn data into insight. In this talk, I will describe two of my efforts to address this problem computationally: The first project, Metro Maps of Information, aims to help people understand the underlying structure of complex topics, such as news stories or research areas. Metro Maps are structured summaries that can help us understand the information landscape, connect the dots between pieces of information, and uncover the big picture. The second project proposes a framework for automatic discovery of insightful connections in data. In particular, we focus on identifying gaps in medical knowledge: our system recommends directions of research that are both novel and promising. I will formulate both problems mathematically and provide efficient, scalable methods for solving them.

Our framework, concise comparative summarization (CCS), is built on sparse classification methods. It is a lightweight and flexible tool that offers a compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently in wide use and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We argue that sparse methods have much to offer for text analysis and hope CCS opens the door for a new branch of research in this important field. Using news articles from the New York Times, we validate our tool by designing and conducting a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human understanding. We demonstrate our approach with two case studies, a media analysis of the framing of Egypt in the New York Times throughout the Arab Spring and an informal comparison of the New York Times and Wall Street Journals coverage of energy. Overall, we find that the Lasso with L2 normalization can be effectively and usefully used to summarize large corpora, regardless of document size. Finally, I will present preliminary results in an on-going project to study the opinions of U.S. courts of appeal by using CCS in combination with LDA.",EECS

Where and how the brain visually encodes 3D object orientation remains unknown, but prior studies suggest the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) may be involved. Here, we develop rigorous analytical methods for quantifying 3D orientation tuning curves, and use these tools to the study the neural coding of surface orientation. Specifically, we show that single neurons in area CIP of the rhesus macaque jointly encode the slant and tilt of a planar surface, and that across the population, the distribution of preferred slant-tilts is not statistically different from uniform. This suggests that all slant-tilt combinations are equally represented in area CIP. Furthermore, some CIP neurons are found to also represent the third rotational degree of freedom that determines the orientation of the image pattern on the planar surface. Together, the present results suggest that CIP is a critical neural locus for the encoding of all three rotational degrees of freedom specifying an objects 3D spatial orientation.

Using a ""know thy enemy"" approach he will address common misconceptions, explore tactical execution, and stare down the hard realities of cyber warfare. And from that terrifying reality he will identify strategic advantages and untapped opportunities that have been hiding under all that FUD. Rob Seger Bio: Rob has more than 16 years of experience in the government sector specifically focusing on security projects and roles. At a very early age, he expressed a keen interest in security, and his first official job at the age of 16 was as a contractor with a government organization working on BIOS level key-loggers and now his experience extends well beyond this into a clear understanding of network-centric exploitation. In more recent roles, he served as an NSA researcher and then as the lead network security architect for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), followed by the role of advanced threat researcher for Chickasaw National Industries. Most recently, he founded and served as CTO for Morta Security (financed by AndreessenHorowitz, Northwest Venture Partners, Data Collective, and Greylock.) At Morta, his responsibilities included design and execution of the Morta product that focuses on highly sophisticated and multi-faceted cyber threat detection. Palo Alto Networks acquired Morta in January, and Rob is currently serving as the lead engineer for their advanced threat solution.

However, many of these advances, and resulting expanding markets, are critically endangered by weaknesses in security, integrity and trust. We investigate the complex and polymorphic subject of trust in these distributed systems and describe a new framework using multiple partially ordered semirings for analyzing reputation and trust establishment, dynamics as well as composite trust. This framework is inspired by thinking of trust problems as path problems in networks. Next we describe our work based on constrained coalitional games towards understanding the role of trust in collaboration and social networks. We describe several specific applications of these methods in securing distributed inference systems, sensor networks for power grids, wireless network routing protocols, distributed control systems.

The intervertebral disc is comprised of mechanically and structurally unique substructures including the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus, which function together to support and absorb spinal loads. Disc degeneration occurs as early as the second decade of life and contributes to over $130 billion in medical costs. Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes. Noninvasive techniques to measure internal mechanical properties will be discussed. Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion. One approach to biological repair strategies that will be discussed is to cultivate engineered tissue in vitro, permitting some elaboration of extracellular matrix for improved long-term outcome following in vivo implantation.",EECS

TRUST Security Seminar: Computational Jewelry for Trustworthy mHealth,Seminar,2014-03-13T13:00:00,2014-03-13T14:00:00,"Soda Hall, Wozniak Lounge","David Kotz, Department of Computer Science, Dartmouth College",Team for Research in Ubiquitous Secure Technology (TRUST),"The advent of mobile health (mHealth) technology brings great opportunity to improve quality of life, improve individual and public health, and reduce healthcare costs. Although mHealth devices and applications are proliferating, many challenges remain to provide the necessary usability, manageability, interoperability, availability, security, and privacy. The vision of the Amulet project is that computational jewelry, in a form like a bracelet or pendant, will provide the properties essential for successful body-area mHealth networks. These devices coordinate the activity of the body-area network and provide a discreet means for communicating with their wearer. Such devices complement the capabilities of a smartphone, bridging the gap between the type of pervasive computing possible with a mobile phone and that enabled by wearable computing. Our interdisciplinary team of investigators is designing and developing Amulet, an electronic bracelet and a software framework that enables developers to create (and users to easily use) safe, secure, and efficient mHealth applications that fit seamlessly into everyday life. The research is determining the degree to which computational jewelry offers advantages in availability, reliability, security, privacy, and usability, and developing techniques that provide these properties in spite of the severely-constrained power resources of wearable jewelry.

Mirkin, Northwestern University, Chemistry / Int'l Institute for Nanotechnology",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The crystallographic parameters of atomic and ionic solids are fixed by the size and coordination number of their elemental building blocks, thus restricting the types of structures that can be formed. We have demonstrated that these limitations can be overcome using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) as artificial atoms in nanoparticle superlattice assemblies. These three-dimensional conjugates consist of densely functionalized, highly oriented nucleic acids covalently attached to the surface of inorganic nanoparticles. The strength and length of the programmable DNA bonds between these structures can be adjusted by varying DNA sequence and length, and the properties of the atoms can be adjusted by varying nanoparticle size, shape, and composition. We have developed design rules for this assembly process, analogous to Paulings Rules for ionic solids but ultimately more powerful. These rules can be used as a guide for the rational construction of functional nanoparticle-based materials for plasmonic, photonic, and catalytic applications.",EECS

There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system. A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy. We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. The assay complements current genetic characterizations of tumor variation between individuals and should greatly speed up the testing of new drugs in research settings.

Engineering Biological Cell Access: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-04-11T14:00:00,2014-04-11T15:00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,"Prof. Nicholas A. Melosh, Stanford University, Materials Science & Engineering",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The cell membrane is one of the most vital components of a cell; the gate-keeper into and out of the cytoplasm. Studies ranging from neural activity to drug discovery to fundamental cell physiology rely upon controlling electronic or chemical flow across this barrier. Unfortunately, our ability to artificially control cellular access is surprisingly poor; current techniques often involve creating holes in or puncturing cell membranes that often cause rapid cell death. Yet precise, non-destructive access to the cell interior can lead to an impressive range of new techniques and devices, ranging from neural-prosthetic interfaces, electrical cell monitoring for disease, to rapid drug screening. These types of technologies are particularly important for the recently announced Brain Activity Map and for harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells as disease models and clinical indicators. One of the critical problems is that we have little knowledge of what happens when the lipid membrane interacts with cell-penetrating materials. Here we explore how inorganic materials with nanoscale molecular functionalization influence and control this vital interface. We discovered that by selectively tuning the hydrophobicity and flexibility of the molecular functionalization we can replicate many of the design features of natural transmembrane proteins, providing non-disruptive mechanical, electrical and chemical access into the cell. These Stealth probes spontaneously insert into lipid membrane, and form tight lipid-post junctions. Force testing with atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of interfacial adhesion, which surprisingly reveals significant adhesion energy differences between molecular groups with similar hydrophobicity but different mobility. This contradicts traditional hydrophobicity indices as indicators of molecular stability in lipid membranes. Similarly, we achieved high-efficiency chemical delivery and control by mimicking nature gap junction proteins to create nanostraw arrays. These nanoscale (100-500 nm) diameter straws are formed based on simple water filtration membranes, and spontaneously penetrate cells plated onto them. We find these provide permanent conduits into cells, permitting delivery of a wide variety of materials that could normally not pass through the cell wall. These two technologies are examples of how the combination of physical sciences and biology can create new beneficial devices that would not be possible in isolation.",EECS

We analyze our model from three perspectives: waiting, optimization, and information. The main insight of our analysis is that waiting to thicken the market can be substantially more important than increasing the speed of transactions, and this is quite robust to the presence of waiting costs. From an optimization perspective, naive local algorithms, that choose the right time to match agents but do not exploit global network structure, can perform very close to optimal algorithms. From an information perspective, algorithms that employ even partial information on agents' departure times perform substantially better than those that lack such information. To elicit agents' departure times, we design an incentive-compatible continuous-time dynamic mechanism without transfers.",EECS
Understanding Materials for Solar Fuel Production: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-04-18T14:00:00,2014-04-18T15:00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,"Prof. Dunwei Wang, Boston College, Dept. of Chemistry",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"Solar energy represents a renewable source that has the potential to meet our ever-increasing energy demand without devastating the environment. One approach to harvesting the energy is to carry out light-powered chemical reactions. Thermodynamically uphill, these reactions produce energetic chemicals that can be used as fuels, promising a large-scale energy storage solution. To enable these reactions, we need materials that can absorb light, separate charges, and catalyze specific chemistries. The materials should be made of earth-abundant elements to allow for large-scale implementations. They also need to be resistant against photo corrosion. To date, a low-cost, long-lasting material that can produce solar fuels with a high efficiency remains elusive. In this talk, we present our efforts aimed at understanding what limits the performance of materials in solar fuel generation reactions. Within the context of photoanode and photocathode, we show how the photoelectrode properties are changed by introducing material components designed for improving charge transport, surface potential accumulation, and interface kinetics, respectively. We also demonstrate that highly complex organic molecules can be produced by photoreduction of CO2, in a fashion closely mimicking the dark reactions in natural photosynthesis. This body of work is enabled by our ability to synthesize materials with precisely controlled surfaces and interfaces using methods such as atomic layer deposition. Our results highlight the importance of understanding thermodynamic and kinetic factors in complex systems such as that for solar fuel production separately. Detailed knowledge generated by our research contributes to the goal of realizing low-cost, high-efficiency artificial photosynthesis.",EECS

In this talk, I will provide an overview our ongoing efforts to design lead salt QD thin film absorbers for next-generation PV. Basic requirements for QD absorber layers include efficient light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, and long-term stability. I will first discuss several methods used to make conductive QD films by solution deposition and ligand exchange. Studies of carrier mobility as a function of basic film parameters such as inter-QD spacing, QD size, and QD size distribution have led to a better understanding of charge transport within highly disordered QD films. Efforts to improve carrier mobility by enhancing inter-dot electronic coupling, passivating surface states, and implementing rudimentary doping will be highlighted. Engineering the inter-QD matrix to produce QD/inorganic or QD/organic nanocomposites is introduced as a promising way to optimize coupling, remove surface states, and achieve long-term environmental stability for high-performance, robust QD films. To obtain large photocurrent from QD solar cells, it is critical to increase the minority carrier diffusion length to rival the optical absorption length, possibly by harnessing band-like transport through extended electronic states. The relative roles of superlattice order, energy disorder, and surface states in this regard will be summarized. The talk will conclude with comments on the prospects for controlled doping and rational p-n junction formation in QD systems.",EECS

The NMDA receptor has been identified as a molecular detector of correlated firing due to its voltage-dependence. Developmental refinement of neuronal circuits is also thought to exploit similar correlation-dependent mechanisms. Consistent with this idea, numerous studies have shown that NMDA receptor blockade or genetic knockout disrupts normal developmental plasticity and circuit refinement. Using a combination of targeted genetic manipulation, and time lapse imaging of axonal remodeling in response to patterned visual stimuli in vivo, we explore the contributions of correlated firing and NMDA receptors in the Xenopus retinotectal system, a classic experimental model for the study of activity-dependent visual system refinement.",BioE

Flanagan Associate Professor in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University Stem cells offer tremendous promise as the basis of regenerative therapies due to their inherent capacity for differentiation into various cell types and their potent ability to secrete a unique cadre of morphogenic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory factors. Engineering the properties of 3D stem cell microenvironments offers a means of regulating their fate and function in an analogous format to the multicellular organization of primitive developing tissues. Simple multicellular aggregates of stem cells permit differentiation and morphogenesis of complex tissue structures, as demonstrated by numerous recent organoid examples, and are directly amenable to scalable suspension culture techniques. Thus, we have taken a systematic approach to the engineering of pluripotent and multipotent stem cell aggregates in order to examine the effects of biophysical and biochemical cues on cell fate, morphogenesis, and secretory function for the purposes of creating in vitro model systems, developing scalable biomanufacturing technologies, and directing innate trophic delivery and regenerative potential. We have demonstrated through a series of studies that hydrodynamic forces created within mixed suspension culture can modulate differentiation and extracellular matrix and growth factor expression of homogeneous populations of pluripotent stem cell aggregates. We have also pioneered the incorporation of different types of biomaterials within 3D aggregates of stem cells as a means of spatiotemporally controlling the delivery of exogenous factors and sequestering of endogenous morphogens that impact stem cell phenotype. More recently we have developed quantitative analytical methods and computational modeling approaches to assess the cellular composition, mechanical properties and patterns of differentiation within single aggregates to complement our experimental efforts to dissect the mechanisms regulating stem cell fate decisions. The sum of these strategies is intended to enhance our understanding of the governing principles dictating stem cell morphogenesis and ultimately translate the potential of stem cells into viable cell-based therapies and diagnostics that transform the future of biomedical research and healthcare practices.

The intervertebral disc is comprised of mechanically and structurally unique substructures including the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus, which function together to support and absorb spinal loads. Disc degeneration occurs as early as the second decade of life and contributes to over $130 billion in medical costs. Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes. Noninvasive techniques to measure internal mechanical properties will be discussed. Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion.

K. Lashmet Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute This talk will describe our efforts to interface bioactive molecules with nanomaterials and nanoscale scaffolds for designing potent therapeutics and functional nanocomposites. The design of polyvalent molecules presenting multiple copies of a specific ligand represents a promising strategy to inhibit pathogens and bacterial toxins. We will first describe the design of polyvalent inhibitors that are orders of magnitude more active than the corresponding monovalent molecules and can neutralize anthrax toxin in vivo. We recently described a thermodynamic analysis to help clarify the theoretical basis for the large enhancements in avidity due to polyvalency. We have used this understanding to guide the structure-based design of potent synthetic polyvalent ligands. The ability to control independently the valency and the spacing between ligands is particularly valuable for these design efforts. To that end, we recently designed monodisperse polypeptide-based polyvalent inhibitors of anthrax toxin in which multiple copies of an inhibitory toxin-binding peptide were separated by flexible peptide linkers. By tuning the valency and linker length, we designed polyvalent inhibitors that were over four orders of magnitude more potent than the corresponding monovalent ligands. Studies relating the composition and structure of polyvalent inhibitors to their activity have also shed light on fundamental aspects of polyvalent recognition, including the role of pattern matching. We will also discuss other applications of polyvalent molecules ranging from the inhibition of pathogens (e.g., the influenza virus) to controlling the nanoscale organization of cellular receptors to regulate signaling and stem cell fate. In addition to the inhibition of bacterial toxins, we are also investigating approaches to target pathogenic bacteria. In particular, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has been a growing concern. We have been exploring an enzyme-based approach to combat pathogenic bacteria. We will describe an approach that we have developed to identify novel bacteriolytic enzymes targeting a variety of bacterial pathogens. We have also investigated the structure and function of these and other enzymes when immobilized onto nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes. Our studies indicate that the nanoscale environment can significantly influence the activity and stability of these proteins. We have used the highly stable and active nanomaterial-protein conjugates to form nanocomposite films that are effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).

We have been exploiting microscale electric fields to manipulate cells in a variety of ways. One example is to sort cells based on their intrinsic electrical properties, which we have applied to understand the genetic basis of electrical properties, as well as apply for point-of-care cell-based assays. Another is to use electric fields to guide the growth of axons, which we can do in 3D and in a non-contact fashion, allowing generation of topologically complex in vitro neural networks.

There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system. A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy. We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. The assay complements current genetic characterizations of tumor variation between individuals and should greatly speed up the testing of new drugs in research settings.

Melosh, Stanford University, Materials Science & Engineering",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The cell membrane is one of the most vital components of a cell; the gate-keeper into and out of the cytoplasm. Studies ranging from neural activity to drug discovery to fundamental cell physiology rely upon controlling electronic or chemical flow across this barrier. Unfortunately, our ability to artificially control cellular access is surprisingly poor; current techniques often involve creating holes in or puncturing cell membranes that often cause rapid cell death. Yet precise, non-destructive access to the cell interior can lead to an impressive range of new techniques and devices, ranging from neural-prosthetic interfaces, electrical cell monitoring for disease, to rapid drug screening. These types of technologies are particularly important for the recently announced Brain Activity Map and for harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells as disease models and clinical indicators. One of the critical problems is that we have little knowledge of what happens when the lipid membrane interacts with cell-penetrating materials. Here we explore how inorganic materials with nanoscale molecular functionalization influence and control this vital interface. We discovered that by selectively tuning the hydrophobicity and flexibility of the molecular functionalization we can replicate many of the design features of natural transmembrane proteins, providing non-disruptive mechanical, electrical and chemical access into the cell. These Stealth probes spontaneously insert into lipid membrane, and form tight lipid-post junctions. Force testing with atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of interfacial adhesion, which surprisingly reveals significant adhesion energy differences between molecular groups with similar hydrophobicity but different mobility. This contradicts traditional hydrophobicity indices as indicators of molecular stability in lipid membranes. Similarly, we achieved high-efficiency chemical delivery and control by mimicking nature gap junction proteins to create nanostraw arrays. These nanoscale (100-500 nm) diameter straws are formed based on simple water filtration membranes, and spontaneously penetrate cells plated onto them. We find these provide permanent conduits into cells, permitting delivery of a wide variety of materials that could normally not pass through the cell wall. These two technologies are examples of how the combination of physical sciences and biology can create new beneficial devices that would not be possible in isolation.",BioE

Our framework, concise comparative summarization (CCS), is built on sparse classification methods. It is a lightweight and flexible tool that offers a compromise between simple word frequency based methods currently in wide use and more heavyweight, model-intensive methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We argue that sparse methods have much to offer for text analysis and hope CCS opens the door for a new branch of research in this important field. Using news articles from the New York Times, we validate our tool by designing and conducting a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human understanding. We demonstrate our approach with two case studies, a media analysis of the framing of Egypt in the New York Times throughout the Arab Spring and an informal comparison of the New York Times and Wall Street Journals coverage of energy. Overall, we find that the Lasso with L2 normalization can be effectively and usefully used to summarize large corpora, regardless of document size.

Is it possible, by active trading, to do better than a market index (say, S&P 500)? The answer to this question is surprisingly tight. If we restrict ourselves to strategies that are functions of the current stock prices, there is exactly one class of trading strategies that achieves this goal. More remarkably, these strategies are produced as solutions of Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem on the multidimensional unit simplex with a cost function that can be described as the log partition function. The ideas are an interplay between convex analysis, probability theory, and the geometry of the unit simplex. We will also show how this theory explains the presence of statistical arbitrage in high-frequency trading. Based on joint work with Leonard Wong.",Statistics

The intervertebral disc is comprised of mechanically and structurally unique substructures including the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus, which function together to support and absorb spinal loads. Disc degeneration occurs as early as the second decade of life and contributes to over $130 billion in medical costs. Disc degeneration causes drastic changes in composition and may lead to altered mechanics; however, the changes in the internal mechanical function of the nucleus and annulus are not well understood. Moreover, injury of the disc, such as herniation of nucleus pulposus material through the annulus fibrosus, causes low back pain and may alter the mechanical function of the disc. Removal of the herniated nucleus pulposus material alleviates low back pain, but may alter the internal mechanical function, which may lead to further degenerative changes. Noninvasive techniques to measure internal mechanical properties will be discussed. Future effective treatment for herniated tissue may include an engineered biological replacement tissue, which may prevent further degeneration and reduce the need for total joint replacement or spinal fusion.

Nix, Materials Science and Engineering, Stanford University",Materials Science and Engineering (MSE),"Understanding the insertion of lithium into silicon electrodes for high capacity lithium-ion batteries is likely to have benefits for mobile energy storage, for both electronics and transportation. Silicon nanostructures have proven to be attractive candidates for electrodes because they provide less constraint on the volume changes that occur and more resistance to fracture during lithium insertion. But still, facture can occur even in nanostructured silicon. Here, we consider the fracture of Si nanopillars during lithiation and find surprising results. We find that fracture is initiated at the surfaces of the crystalline nanopillars and not in the interior, as had been predicted by analyses based on diffusion-induced stresses. In situ transmission electron microscopy observations of initially crystalline Si nanoparticles shows that lithiation occurs by the growth of an amorphous lithiated shell, subjected to tension, at the expense of a crystalline Si core, subjected to compression. We also show that the expansion of the nanopillars is highly anisotropic and that the fracture locations are also anisotropic. In addition, we find a critical fracture diameter for initially crystalline nanopillars of about 300nm that appears to depend on the electrochemical reaction rate. Modeling the stress evolution in Si nanopillars during lithiation provides a way to understand and control these failure processes. Also, we show that initially amorphous Si nanopillars are much more resistant to failure, having much larger critical fracture diameters, because the initial stresses at the surface are compressive in this situation compared to tension in the case of initially crystalline nanopillars. For sufficiently big amorphous Si nanopillars, cracking is expected to be initiated in the interior based on diffusion-induced stresses, but we have not yet observed this kind of fracture. The modeling we, and others, have done has been based largely on estimates or guesses about the mechanical properties of lithiated Si. Recent nanoindentation experiments show that the elastic modulus and hardness of lithiated amorphous Si depend strongly on the lithium content and also show very significant creep effects. These more subtle effects may need to be included in future modeling. It is hoped that these studies will be useful in the design of silicon electrodes for advanced battery systems.

Simply physically manipulating cellsusing microfluidics, electric fields, or optical forcesprovides new ways to separate cells and organize cell-cell interactions. We have been exploiting microscale electric fields to manipulate cells in a variety of ways. One example is to sort cells based on their intrinsic electrical properties, which we have applied to understand the genetic basis of electrical properties, as well as apply for point-of-care cell-based assays. Another is to use electric fields to guide the growth of axons, which we can do in 3D and in a non-contact fashion, allowing generation of topologically complex in vitro neural networks. Together, these new microscale tools provide ways to exploit cells potential for both basic science and applied biotechnology.",Nanosciences

Personalizing Cancer Diagnostics Using Microfluidics: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-04-04T14:00:00,2014-04-04T15:00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,"Prof. Albert Folch, Univ. of Washington, Bioengineering",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"Cancer therapy has a critical unmet need, which is to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. There are currently over 250 FDA-approved drugs for cancer chemotherapy. Most of these were identified and are applied empirically, either alone or in combination, to treat cancer. Drug choice is guided largely by a) tumor type, location and stage, and b) efficacy of therapy as assessed in prior clinical trials using groups of patients. The response of individual patients to these standard-of-care therapies often varies widely. Ineffective therapies extract an enormous toll on individual patients and their families as well as on the health care system. A more rational and cost-effective way to improve cancer therapy, maximize the likelihood of response or cure, and minimize toxicity, would be to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutic agents before starting therapy. We have developed a multiplexed microfluidic assay designed to identify the best therapy for individual cancer patients. This assay utilizes intact tissue in order to rapidly predict tumor chemosensitivity to a large panel of drugs prior to initiation of therapy. The assay complements current genetic characterizations of tumor variation between individuals and should greatly speed up the testing of new drugs in research settings. I will demonstrate how bringing these microfluidic devices into the clinic will greatly enabled by the use of stereolithography, a form of 3D printing.",Nanosciences

Engineering Biological Cell Access: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-04-11T14:00:00,2014-04-11T15:00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,"Prof. Nicholas A. Melosh, Stanford University, Materials Science & Engineering",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"The cell membrane is one of the most vital components of a cell; the gate-keeper into and out of the cytoplasm. Studies ranging from neural activity to drug discovery to fundamental cell physiology rely upon controlling electronic or chemical flow across this barrier. Unfortunately, our ability to artificially control cellular access is surprisingly poor; current techniques often involve creating holes in or puncturing cell membranes that often cause rapid cell death. Yet precise, non-destructive access to the cell interior can lead to an impressive range of new techniques and devices, ranging from neural-prosthetic interfaces, electrical cell monitoring for disease, to rapid drug screening. These types of technologies are particularly important for the recently announced Brain Activity Map and for harnessing the potential of induced pluripotent stem cells as disease models and clinical indicators. One of the critical problems is that we have little knowledge of what happens when the lipid membrane interacts with cell-penetrating materials. Here we explore how inorganic materials with nanoscale molecular functionalization influence and control this vital interface. We discovered that by selectively tuning the hydrophobicity and flexibility of the molecular functionalization we can replicate many of the design features of natural transmembrane proteins, providing non-disruptive mechanical, electrical and chemical access into the cell. These Stealth probes spontaneously insert into lipid membrane, and form tight lipid-post junctions. Force testing with atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides a quantitative measure of interfacial adhesion, which surprisingly reveals significant adhesion energy differences between molecular groups with similar hydrophobicity but different mobility. This contradicts traditional hydrophobicity indices as indicators of molecular stability in lipid membranes. Similarly, we achieved high-efficiency chemical delivery and control by mimicking nature gap junction proteins to create nanostraw arrays. These nanoscale (100-500 nm) diameter straws are formed based on simple water filtration membranes, and spontaneously penetrate cells plated onto them. We find these provide permanent conduits into cells, permitting delivery of a wide variety of materials that could normally not pass through the cell wall. These two technologies are examples of how the combination of physical sciences and biology can create new beneficial devices that would not be possible in isolation.",Nanosciences
Understanding Materials for Solar Fuel Production: Nano Seminar Series,Seminar,2014-04-18T14:00:00,2014-04-18T15:00:00,390 Hearst Memorial Mining Building,"Prof. Dunwei Wang, Boston College, Dept. of Chemistry",Berkeley Nanosciences and Nanoengineering Institute,"Solar energy represents a renewable source that has the potential to meet our ever-increasing energy demand without devastating the environment. One approach to harvesting the energy is to carry out light-powered chemical reactions. Thermodynamically uphill, these reactions produce energetic chemicals that can be used as fuels, promising a large-scale energy storage solution. To enable these reactions, we need materials that can absorb light, separate charges, and catalyze specific chemistries. The materials should be made of earth-abundant elements to allow for large-scale implementations. They also need to be resistant against photo corrosion. To date, a low-cost, long-lasting material that can produce solar fuels with a high efficiency remains elusive. In this talk, we present our efforts aimed at understanding what limits the performance of materials in solar fuel generation reactions. Within the context of photoanode and photocathode, we show how the photoelectrode properties are changed by introducing material components designed for improving charge transport, surface potential accumulation, and interface kinetics, respectively. We also demonstrate that highly complex organic molecules can be produced by photoreduction of CO2, in a fashion closely mimicking the dark reactions in natural photosynthesis. This body of work is enabled by our ability to synthesize materials with precisely controlled surfaces and interfaces using methods such as atomic layer deposition. Our results highlight the importance of understanding thermodynamic and kinetic factors in complex systems such as that for solar fuel production separately. Detailed knowledge generated by our research contributes to the goal of realizing low-cost, high-efficiency artificial photosynthesis.",Nanosciences

Our own early work was initially very much exploratory research, testing to what extent we could understand, control and have fun with the ways in which nanowires nucleate and grow. The whole field of nanowires saw great progress in the use of nanowires for physics and for fairly simple model devices. Just in the last five, or so, years we have seen serious break-through in novel growth methods and the understanding of nanowire growth, as well as in the development of new technologies enabling efficient fabrication of nanowires for areas like solar cells and light-emitting diodes. In this talk I will cover all these areas, with an emphasis on recent progress in controlled and efficient fabrication of nanowires for energy applications.",Nanosciences

In this talk, I will provide an overview our ongoing efforts to design lead salt QD thin film absorbers for next-generation PV. Basic requirements for QD absorber layers include efficient light absorption, charge separation, charge transport, and long-term stability. I will first discuss several methods used to make conductive QD films by solution deposition and ligand exchange. Studies of carrier mobility as a function of basic film parameters such as inter-QD spacing, QD size, and QD size distribution have led to a better understanding of charge transport within highly disordered QD films. Efforts to improve carrier mobility by enhancing inter-dot electronic coupling, passivating surface states, and implementing rudimentary doping will be highlighted. Engineering the inter-QD matrix to produce QD/inorganic or QD/organic nanocomposites is introduced as a promising way to optimize coupling, remove surface states, and achieve long-term environmental stability for high-performance, robust QD films. To obtain large photocurrent from QD solar cells, it is critical to increase the minority carrier diffusion length to rival the optical absorption length, possibly by harnessing band-like transport through extended electronic states. The relative roles of superlattice order, energy disorder, and surface states in this regard will be summarized. The talk will conclude with comments on the prospects for controlled doping and rational p-n junction formation in QD systems.",Nanosciences

We analyze our model from three perspectives: waiting, optimization, and information. The main insight of our analysis is that waiting to thicken the market can be substantially more important than increasing the speed of transactions, and this is quite robust to the presence of waiting costs. From an optimization perspective, naive local algorithms, that choose the right time to match agents but do not exploit global network structure, can perform very close to optimal algorithms. From an information perspective, algorithms that employ even partial information on agents' departure times perform substantially better than those that lack such information. To elicit agents' departure times, we design an incentive-compatible continuous-time dynamic mechanism without transfers.",Economics

First, we consider a field experiment conducted by Sweden's monopoly alcohol retailer and find that moving purchases from behind the counter to self-service disproportionately increases the sales of difficult-to-to-pronounce products. Second, we use individual-level panel data from a pizza delivery restaurant to show that online orders have more complexity, calories, and diversity, and measure the consequences for consumer and producer surplus. Combined, these results suggest that social frictions can substantially affect market outcomes.",Economics

Music Studies Colloquium - Gjerdingen: The Institutionalization of Apprenticeship in the Great Conservatories: A Cognitive Interpretation of a Non-Verbal Praxis,Performing Arts - Music,2014-03-17T16:30:00,2014-03-17T18:00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Robert Gjerdingen, Northwestern University",Department of Music,"Music, like all the other crafts of pre-industrial Europe, was learned through apprenticeship. When formalized, an apprenticeship often involved a ten-year indenture of a young boy or girl to a master or mistress. Unpaid labor was exchanged for entry into the mystery of the craft. The four conservatori or foundling homes of Naples were the first to institutionalize this indenture, ultimately aggregating as many as 600 boys for the intense study of music. Just as the four Inns of Court in London raised clerkship to a higher level in English law, so the conservatories of Naples created a critical mass of young talents such as Europe had never seen. By the end of the nineteenth century almost every industrializing nation had established its own version of a music conservatory. Perhaps the low social status of foundlings and performing musicians and their hermetic insiders praxis (a hold-over from the closed world of craft guilds) led educated writers on music to overlook or to deprecate the mindless repetitive exercises of the conservatories. Even when, at the Paris Conservatory, the work of replicating master patterns was raised to a level of finesse comparable to that of the École des Beaux-Arts, it was still not considered of any theoretical significance. Only from the mid-1990s did a small group of scholars begin to re-examine and rediscover what was being learned in the great conservatories. In modern terms, we can now recognize a systematic praxis aimed at the building up of a huge repertory of schemata or constructions, which collectively operated like what contemporary linguists term a usage-based grammar. The goal of such an undertaking would be to produce native speakers of a language, and the many great composers who emerged from this training would seem to support its efficacy.",Performances

They were produced in Switzerland and Germany in exceptionally prolific artisan environments. The artisans designed them so that they not merely played music but also performed contemporary sentimental-musical body techniques (through moving their eyes, heads, and torsos) to communicate affects to the audience that were generated by the musical piece. My talk investigates the artisan and musical-cultural environments in which androids and their meanings were produced in the eighteenth century and probes also the boundaries between such different economic and cultural environments. The talk's second part traces how eighteenth-century musical automata's interpretations changed significantly during the industrial revolutions of the 19th and the wars of the 20th centuries: literary and cultural critics detached them from their original musical-historical context and appropriated them as harbingers of the catastrophes of industrial modernity. The musical element of the mechanics of the androids helps me rescue this part of their android identity and thus re-visit both technical and cultural modernities.",Performances

Music Studies Colloquium - Wong: Rereading Ethnomusicology for Gender and Erotics,Performing Arts - Music,2014-04-07T16:30:00,2014-04-07T18:00:00,128 Morrison Hall,"Deborah Wong, UC Riverside",Department of Music,"How and why did gender studies move so quickly through ethnomusicology, and then (mostly) disappear? Why has sexuality studies barely made any appearance at all, despite musics central role in shaping desire? Ethnomusicology moved to a post-gender stance with lightning speed. That is, after key publications about women/gender and music in the 1980s-90s, ethnomusicologists began to add the phrase and gender to their arguments but to a great extent stopped focusing on it. As Ellen Koskoff has written, after a brief spurt in the late 1980s and into the 1990s, work in feminist and genderist ethnomusicology seemed to slow in relation to that of musicology(Koskoff 2005, 90). I offer a reclamation model meant to dialogically regroup, recoup, and reformulate existing ethnomusicological scholarship. Attention to gendered orders of music is missing from much of our most treasured literature, and I aim to reread itto read it anew, to read it with new eyesnot in order to rescue it but to fold the gesture of critique into our work as I make visible the invisibility of gender in so much of our best scholarship. This is in some ways homage and in others an openly counterfactual history. I will reread my own book on Thai music by folding in current media coverage of spectacularly misogynistic demonstrations against the female Prime Minister. I will reread several key monographs by other ethnomusicologists to consider the range of acts available to usradical rereading, evocative/poetic rereading, mournful rereadingwhile arguing that this agentive feminist act of reading (refusing the apparent absence) is an extension of the gaze exerted by subalterns of many kinds in many places. I aim to activate a bifocal consciousness and to exert the black look articulated by bell hooks to theorize a reading method for ethnomusicologists that traces the ghostly presence of gender and erotics, reading around their apparent absence for their outlines and sonic traces. I will draw from the abundance of theories addressing the act of oppositional watching/listening and theories for rereading from philosophy and education, which emphasize how re-knowing and re-cognition is part of the rereading process. Can a second reading open up a third space? Neither a rescue operation nor an apologist celebration, this is instead a deeply necessary and respectful effort to reengage with (rather than disengage from) leading scholarship by ethnomusicologists that has mostly turned a blind eye toward gender and sexuality. I offer both a practical method and a theory of rereading drawn from feminist theory, minoritarian studies, and translation studies.",Performances

The subsequent aftershocks, fires, and ensuing panic bred rumors that malcontent Koreans living in Japan were setting the fires, poisoning water wells, and plotting a revolution. To prevent this alleged uprising, vigilantes along with police and the military massacred more than 6,000 Koreans. Partly to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the massacre, two unreleased rare documentaries from Japan have been touring the United States since last September. The films feature interviews with Japanese and Korean survivors, and the first of the two sequel films ""Hidden Scars: The Massacre of Koreans From the Arakawa River Bank to Shitamachi in Tokyo, 1923 will be shown. The movie was directed by Choonkong Oh, a Korean resident of Japan, and is in Japanese and Korean with English subtitles. The documentary is under an hour long, and will be followed by a discussion featuring Jinhee Lee, a history professor at Eastern Illinois University whose research focuses on the competing narratives of collective violence in the Japanese empire.",Films

But unlike last time, he has no money, no machine, no nothing. In his previous 2005 by-election depicted in ""Campaign"", Kazuhiko ""Yama-san"" Yamauchi was the official candidate of the LDP, headed by then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. He won the vacant seat, fully backed by the LDP's political machine. However, for the election in 2007, the LDP did not endorse Yama-san, and backed a different candidate. For the past 4 years, Yama-san has stayed away from politics, living as a ""house husband"" to raise his newborn son Yuki. So, this election in 2011 is a come-back attempt by Yama-san after 4 quiet years. But the situation is not so forgiving. The total budget for his campaign is now only 84,720 Japanese Yen (about $850)  all for printing posters and postcards. Does he even stand a chance? Filmmaker Kazuhiro Soda debuted with ""Campaign"" in 2007 at the Berlinale, and has been winning international awards with his observational film series such as ""Mental"" (2008), ""Peace"" (2010), and ""Theatre 1 & 2"" (2012). ""Campaign 2"" candidly captures the mechanical lives of the Japanese people, firmly adhered to even in the midst of a disaster where radioactive material is falling from the sky. Soda's camera, which had maintained an outsider's position in ""Campaign, gradually gets ensnared in the situation. Conflict between the filmmaker and the subjects eventually escalates and finally comes to a head. Official film website",Films
